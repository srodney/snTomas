	Abstract = {We present a strong and weak lensing reconstruction of the massive cluster Abell 2744, the first cluster for which deep \emph{Hubble Frontier Field} (HFF) images and spectroscopy from the \emph{Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space} (GLASS) are available. By performing a targeted search for emission lines in multiply imaged sources using GLASS spectra, we obtain 5 secure spectroscopic redshifts and 2 tentative ones. We confirm 1 strongly lensed system by detecting the same emission lines in all 3 multiple images. We also search for additional line emitters blindly and use the full GLASS spectroscopic catalog to test reliability of photometric redshifts for faint line emitters. We see a reasonable agreement between our photometric and spectroscopic redshift measurements, when including nebular emission in photo-z estimations. We introduce a stringent procedure to identify only secure multiple image sets based on colors, morphology, and spectroscopy. By combining 7 multiple image systems with secure spectroscopic redshifts (at 5 distinct redshift planes) with 18 multiple image systems with secure photometric redshifts, we reconstruct the gravitational potential of the cluster pixellated on an adaptive grid, using a total of 72 images. The resulting mass map is compared with a stellar mass map obtained from the deep \emph{Spitzer} Frontier Fields data to study the relative distribution of stars and dark matter in the cluster. We find that the stellar to total mass ratio varies substantially across the cluster, suggesting that stars do not trace exactly the total mass in this interacting cluster. The maps of convergence, shear, and magnification are made available in the standard HFF format.},

	Abstract = {Context.1987A-like events form a rare sub-group of hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae that are thought to originate from the explosion of blue supergiant stars. Although SN 1987A is the best known supernova, very few objects of this group have been discovered and, hence, studied.  Aims: In this paper we investigate the properties of SN 2009E, which exploded in a relatively nearby spiral galaxy (NGC 4141) and that is probably the faintest 1987A-like supernova discovered so far. We also attempt to characterize this subgroup of core-collapse supernovae with the help of the literature and present new data for a few additional objects.  Methods: The lack of early-time observations from professional telescopes is compensated by frequent follow-up observations performed by a number of amateur astronomers. This allows us to reconstruct a well-sampled light curve for SN 2009E. Spectroscopic observations which started about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significant differences between SN 2009E and the prototypical SN 1987A. Modelling the data of SN 2009E allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the properties of the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those available for the similar SNe 1987A and 1998A.  Results: The light curve of SN 2009E is less luminous than that of SN 1987A and the other members of this class, and the maximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in SN 1987A. Late-time photometric observations suggest that SN 2009E ejected about 0.04 M&sun; of 56Ni, which is the smallest 56Ni mass in our sample of 1987A-like events. Modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamics code, we infer for SN 2009E a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, an initial radius of ~7 × 1012 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 M&sun;. The photospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v ≈ 1800 km s-1) metal lines, with unusually strong Ba II lines. The nebular spectrum displays narrow emission lines of H, Na I, [Ca II] and [O I], with the [O I] feature being relatively strong compared to the [Ca II] doublet. The overall spectroscopic evolution is reminiscent of that of the faint 56Ni-poor type II-plateau supernovae. This suggests that SN 2009E belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56Ni mass, low-energy tail in the distribution of the 1987A-like objects in the same manner as SN 1997D and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution of physical properties for normal type II-plateau supernovae.

@article{Kelly:2015,
	Abstract = {In 1964, Refsdal hypothesized that a supernova whose light traversed multiple paths around a strong gravitational lens could be used to measure the rate of cosmic expansion. We report the discovery of such a system. In Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have found four images of a single supernova forming an Einstein cross configuration around a redshift z = 0.54 elliptical galaxy in the MACS J1149.6+2223 cluster. The cluster's gravitational potential also creates multiple images of the z = 1.49 spiral supernova host galaxy, and a future appearance of the supernova elsewhere in the cluster field is expected. The magnifications and staggered arrivals of the supernova images probe the cosmic expansion rate, as well as the distribution of matter in the galaxy and cluster lenses.},

@article{Bayliss:2015,
	Abstract = {We test the effects of varying the cosmological parameter values used in the strong lens modeling process for the six Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy clusters. The standard procedure for generating high-fidelity strong lens models includes careful consideration of uncertainties in the output models that result from varying model parameters within the bounds of available data constraints. It is not, however, common practice to account for the effects of cosmological parameter value uncertainties. The convention is to instead use a single fiducial ``concordance cosmology'' and generate lens models assuming zero uncertainty in cosmological parameter values. We find that the magnification maps of the individual HFF clusters vary significantly when lens models are computed using different cosmological parameter values taken from recent literature constraints from space- and ground-based experiments. Specifically, the magnification maps have average variances across the best-fit models computed using different cosmologies that are comparable in magnitude to---and as much as 2.5× larger than---the model-fitting uncertainties in each best-fit model. We also find that estimates of the mass profiles of the cluster cores themselves vary only slightly when different input cosmological parameters are used. We conclude that cosmological parameter uncertainty is a non-negligible source of uncertainty in lens model products for the HFF clusters and that it is important that current and future work that relies on precision strong-lensing models take care to account for this additional source of uncertainty.},

@article{Hinshaw:2013,
	Abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LambdaCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Omega b  h 2, Omega c  h 2, and OmegaLambda, are each determined to a precision of ~1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LambdaCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LambdaCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \Omega _k = -0.0027^{+ 0.0039}_{- 0.0038}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m nu < 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

	Abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

@article{Zitrin:2014a,
	Abstract = {We discuss how Type Ia supernovae (SNe) strongly magnified by foreground galaxy clusters should be self-consistently treated when used in samples fitted for the cosmological parameters. While the cluster lens magnification of a SN can be well constrained from sets of multiple images of various background galaxies with measured redshifts, its value is typically dependent on the fiducial set of cosmological parameters used to construct the mass model. In such cases, one should not naively demagnify the observed SN luminosity by the model magnification into the expected Hubble diagram, which would create a bias, but instead take into account the cosmological parameters a priori chosen to construct the mass model. We quantify the effect and find that a systematic error of typically a few percent, up to a few dozen percent per magnified SN may be propagated onto a cosmological parameter fit unless the cosmology assumed for the mass model is taken into account (the bias can be even larger if the SN is lying very near the critical curves). We also simulate how such a bias propagates onto the cosmological parameter fit using the Union2.1 sample supplemented with strongly magnified SNe. The resulting bias on the deduced cosmological parameters is generally at the few percent level, if only few biased SNe are included, and increases with the number of lensed SNe and their redshift. Samples containing magnified Type Ia SNe, e.g., from ongoing cluster surveys, should readily account for this possible bias.},

@article{Kassiola:1993,
	Abstract = {We present analytic expressions for deflections by gravitational lenses made of homoeoidal elliptic mass distributions (EMDs) with a variety of radial profiles. We study in detail pseudoisothermal elliptic mass distributions (PIEMDs) and give analytic formulae for their time delay, deflection, magnification matrix, sizes of caustics and critical lines, and parameters of umbilici. The analytic tractability makes elliptic mass lenses almost as convenient as lenses with elliptic potentials (EPs), both for computer simulations and for qualitative analysis.  We compare the topography, critical behavior and imaging properties of PIEMDs and of lenses with a pseudoisothermal elliptic potential (PIEP).  The two lenses are similar in many aspects, however: PIEMD can represent masses of any elongation, while physically meaningful PIEP lenses are limited to mass distributions with axis ratios b/a ≳ 0.5 and therefore cannot represent almost half of the galaxies and clusters in the universe.  A notable difference between the imaging properties of the two lens models is that PIEMDs have much more freedom to form caustics with naked cusps. Naked cusps are involved in the formation of some of the giant arcs and in statistics of multiple QSO images.  To study statistics of multiple imaging, we simulated altogether ˜2 × 106 multiple QSO cases imaged by isolated galaxies, identified seven types of image configurations, and obtained predictions for relative frequencies of these types for a variety of sampling conditions. The sampling conditions include thresholds for resolution, for next flux, and for flux ratio between the brightest and the faintest resolved images. Next, we adopted a requirement to be satisfied by our predictions for relative frequencies of two- and three-image cases, to fit observations. This requirement leads to constants on the central surface mass density of galaxies, which are stronger for PIEMDs than for PIEP models, largely because of the triple images of sources inside naked cusps.  Finally, we demonstrate that galaxies responsible for QSO lens cases with four or five images are biased to larger ellipticities than galaxies in general.  In addition to the simplest pseudoisothermal example, combinations of elementary analytic lens models with elliptic mass distributions have a considerable freedom to approximate gravitational lenses with variable radial profiles and ellipticities.},

@article{Dobke:2009,
	Abstract = {Upcoming ground- and space-based observatories, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Joint Dark Energy Mission concepts and the Square Kilometre Array, promise to dramatically increase the size of strong gravitational lens samples. A significant fraction of the systems is expected to be time-delay lenses. Due to the sensitivity of time delays to cosmological parameters, this increase in sample size opens up new avenues of parameter constraint. Many of the existing lensing degeneracies, e.g. between the Hubble parameter H0 and the slope of the density profile of the lens, become less of an issue with large samples since the distributions of a number of parameters are predictable, and can be incorporated into an analysis, thus helping to lessen the degeneracy. Assuming a mean galaxy density profile that does not evolve with redshift, a Lambda cold dark matter cosmology, and Gaussian distributions for bulk parameters describing the lens and source populations, we generate synthetic lens catalogues and examine the relationship between constraints on the Omegam-OmegaLambda plane and H0 with increasing lens sample size. We find that, with sample sizes of ~400 time-delay lenses, useful constraints can be obtained for Omegam and OmegaLambda with approximately similar levels of precision as from the best of other methods. In addition, sample sizes of ~100 time-delay systems yield estimates of H0 with errors of only a couple of per cent, exceeding the level of precision from current best estimates such as the Hubble Space Telescope key project. As such, strong lensing promises to become one of the premier methods for constraining the Hubble constant in the future. We note that insufficient prior knowledge of the lens samples employed in the analysis, via under or overestimates in the mean values of the sample distributions, results in the broadening of constraints. This highlights the need for sound prior knowledge of the sample before useful cosmological constraints can be obtained from large time-delay samples.},

	Abstract = {Cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable of detecting time-varying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in large numbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-defined samples of multiply imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the first strongly lensed supernovae. We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account. We find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should find more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also find some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with ~15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be ~15 per cent for the lensed quasars and ~30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals are sigma(w0) = 0.15, sigma(wa) = 0.41 and sigma(h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.},

	Abstract = {Future large ensembles of time delay (TD) lenses have the potential to provide interesting cosmological constraints complementary to those of other methods. In a flat universe with constant w including a Planck prior, The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope TD measurements for ~4000 lenses should constrain the local Hubble constant h to ~0.007 (~1%), Omega de  to ~0.005, and w to ~0.026 (all 1sigma precisions). Similar constraints could be obtained by a dedicated gravitational lens observatory (OMEGA) which would obtain precise TD and mass model measurements for ~100 well-studied lenses. We compare these constraints (as well as those for a more general cosmology) to the "optimistic Stage IV" constraints expected from weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cluster counts, as calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force. TDs yield a modest constraint on a time-varying w(z), with the best constraint on w(z) at the "pivot redshift" of z ≈ 0.31. Our Fisher matrix calculation is provided to allow TD constraints to be easily compared to and combined with constraints from other experiments. We also show how cosmological constraining power varies as a function of numbers of lenses, lens model uncertainty, TD precision, redshift precision, and the ratio of four-image to two-image lenses.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the potential of using massive clusters as gravitational telescopes for searches and studies of supernovae of Type Ia and Type II in optical and near-infrared bands at central wavelengths in the interval 0.8-1.25 mu m. Using high-redshift supernova rates derived from the measured star formation rate, we find the most interesting effects for the detection of core-collapse SNe in searches at limiting magnitudes mlim ~  25-26.5 mag, where the total detection rate could be significantly enhanced and the number of detectable events is considerable even in a small field. For shallower searches,  ~ 24 mag, a net gain factor of up to 3 in the discovery rate could be obtained, and yet a much larger factor for very high source redshifts. For programs such as the GOODS/ACS transient survey, the discovery rate of supernovae beyond z ~  2 could be significantly increased if the observations were done in the direction of massive clusters. For extremely deep observations, mlim > 27 mag, or for very bright SNe (e.g. Type Ia) the competing effect of field reduction by lensing dominates, and fewer supernovae are likely to be discovered behind foreground clusters.},

	Abstract = {Supernovae in distant galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters make excellent standard candles for measuring cosmological quantities like the density of the Universe in its various components and the Hubble constant. Distant supernovae would be rendered more easily detectable in the fields of rich galaxy clusters since the latter could act as foreground lenses, magnifying such supernovae by up to 3-4 magnitudes. We show that in the case of the lens cluster Abell 2218, the detectability of high-redshift supernovae is significantly enhanced due to the lensing effects of the cluster. The signal-to-noise ratio for the observation of lensed supernovae will be further enhanced, typically by an order of magnitude, since they will remain point images even when their host galaxies are stretched into arcs by the effect of lensing. We recommend monitoring with medium-sized telescopes well-modelled clusters with several known arclets for the detection of cosmologically useful SNe around z=1 and beyond.},

@article{Kolatt:1998,
	Abstract = {We propose a method to remove the mass-sheet degeneracy that arises when the mass of galaxy clusters is inferred from gravitational shear. The method utilizes high-redshift standard candles that undergo weak lensing. Natural candidates for such standard candles are type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). When corrected with the light-curve shape (LCS), the peak magnitude of SNe Ia provides a standard candle with an uncertainty in apparent magnitude of Deltam~=0.1-0.2. Gravitational magnification of a background SN Ia by an intervening cluster would cause a mismatch between the observed SN Ia peak magnitude compared with that expected from its LCS and redshift. The average detection rate for SNe Ia with a significant mismatch of >=2Deltam behind a cluster at z~=0.05-0.15 is about 1-2 supernovae per cluster per year at J, I, R<~25-26. Since SNe are point-like sources for a limited period, they can experience significant microlensing by massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) in the intracluster medium. Microlensing events caused by MACHOs of ~10^-4 Msolar are expected to have time-scales similar to that of the SN light curve. Both the magnification curve by a MACHO and the light curve of a SN Ia have characteristic shapes that allow us to separate them. Microlensing events caused by MACHOs of smaller mass can unambiguously be identified in the SN light curve if the latter is continuously monitored. The average number of identifiable microlensing events per nearby cluster (z<~0.05) per year is ~0.02 (f/0.01), where f is the fraction of the cluster mass in MACHOs of masses 10^-7<M_macho/Msolar<10^-4.},

The part of a galaxy located inside a cusp has three images of itself within an arc. The arcs are very blue, so the galaxies may be in a stage of active star formation with supernovae exploding every few years. If a supernova goes off inside a cusp it will be observed thrice, at three positions. The apparent magnitudes of the supernovae images may be M(R) roughly 20-23. The arrival time differences between the images can be as short as a few weeks or even days, whereas for ordinary lenses on a cluster scale the differences can be decades to centuries. Simple relations between the ratios of the arrival time differences, magnifications, and image separations are predicted.},

@article{Richard:2006,
	Abstract = {We present the first results of our deep survey of lensing clusters aimed at constraining the abundance of star-forming galaxies at z˜6-10, using lensing magnification to improve the search efficiency and subsequent spectroscopic studies. Deep near-IR photometry of two lensing clusters (A1835 and AC114) was obtained with ISAAC/VLT. These images, combined with existing data in the optical bands including HST images, were used to select very high redshift candidates at z⪆ 6 among the optical-dropouts. Photometric selection criteria have been defined based on the well-proven dropout technique, specifically tuned to target star-forming galaxies in this redshift domain. We have identified 18(8) first and second-category optical dropouts in A1835 (AC114), detected in more than one filter up to H (Vega) ˜ 23.8 (AB ~ 25.2, uncorrected for lensing). Among them, 8(5) exhibit homogeneous SEDs compatible with star-forming galaxies at z⪆ 6, and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift EROs based on luminosity considerations. We have also identified a number of fainter sources in these fields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the critical lines. We use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining the density of star-forming galaxies present at 6⪅ z ⪅10 using lensing clusters. Magnification effects and sample incompleteness are addressed through a careful modeling of the lensing clusters. A correction was also introduced to account for the expected fraction of false-positive detections among this photometric sample. It appears that the number of candidates found in these lensing fields, corrected for magnification, incompleteness and false-positive detections, is higher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth in the near-IR. The luminosity function derived for z⪆ 6 candidates appears compatible with that of LBGs at z~= 3, without any renormalization. The turnover observed by Bouwens et al. (2005) towards the bright end relative to the z˜ 3 LF is not observed in this sample. Also the upper limit for the UV SFR density at z˜6-10, integrated down to L1500=0.3~L*z=3, of rho_*=7.4 × 10-2~M&sun; yr-1 Mpc-3 is compatible with the usual values derived at z ~= 5-6, but higher than the estimates obtained in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF). The same holds for the upper limit of the SFR density in the z ~= 8-10 interval (rho_*=1.1 × 10-1). This systematic trend towards the bright end of the LF with respect to blank fields could be due to field-to-field variance, a positive magnification bias from intermediate-redshift EROs, and/or residual contamination. Given the low S/N ratio of the high-z candidates, and the large correction factors applied to this sample, increasing the number of blank and lensing fields with ultra-deep near-IR photometry is essential to obtain more accurate constraints on the abundance of z ⪆ 6 galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed continuum Lyman break ``dropouts'' beyond a redshift 7 conducted via very deep imaging through six foreground clusters undertaken with the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. The survey has yielded 10 z-band and two J-band dropout candidates to photometric limits of J110~=26.2 AB (5 sigma). Taking into account the magnifications afforded by our clusters (1-4 mag), we probe the presence of z>7 sources to unlensed limits of J110~=30 AB, fainter than those charted in the Hubble Ultradeep Field. To verify the fidelity of our candidates we conduct a number of tests for instrumental effects which would lead to spurious detections, and carefully evaluate the likelihood of foreground contamination by considering photometric uncertainties in the dropout signature, the upper limits from stacked IRAC data and the statistics of multiply imaged sources. Overall, we conclude that we can expect about half of our sample of z-band dropouts to be at high redshift. An ambitious infrared spectroscopic campaign undertaken with the NIRSPEC spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory for seven of the most promising candidates failed to detect any Lyalpha emission highlighting the challenge of making further progress in this field. While the volume density of high-redshift sources will likely remain uncertain until more powerful facilities are available, our data provides the first potentially interesting constraints on the UV luminosity function at z~=7.5 at intrinsically faint limits. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of the hypothesis that the bulk of the reionizing photons in the era 7<z<12 arise in low-luminosity galaxies undetected by conventional surveys.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a redshift z=6.56 galaxy lying behind the cluster Abell 370. The object HCM 6A was found in a narrowband imaging survey using a 118 {\AA} bandpass filter centered at 9152 {\AA} in the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) camera on the 10 m Keck II telescope. Candidate Lyalpha emitters were identified by the equivalent width of the emission and the absence of lower wavelength flux in ultradeep broadband images. HCM 6A is the first galaxy to be confirmed at redshift z>6 and has Wlambda(observed)= 190 {\AA}, flux=2.7×10-17 ergs cm-2 s-1. Spectra obtained with LRIS confirm the emission line and the continuum break across the line and show an asymmetric line profile with steep falloff on the blue side. Deep Subaru near-infrared Cooled Infrared Spectrograph and Camera for OHS images in J, H, and K' that extend the sampled continuum to longer wavelengths give a consistent estimate of the continuum flux density in these line-free regions of (2.6+/-0.7)×10-30 ergs cm-2 s-1 Hz-1. The line width and strength, asymmetric profile, and very deep spectral break are only consistent with the interpretation of the line as a redshifted Lyalpha feature. From the detailed lensing model of this cluster, we estimate a lensing amplification of 4.5 for this galaxy, which is located slightly over an arcminute from the center of the cluster, for an unlensed flux of 6.5×10-18 ergs cm-2 s-1. The presence of such a galaxy suggests that the reionizing epoch is beyond z=6.6.

	Abstract = {We discuss the physical nature of a remarkably faint pair of Lyalpha-emitting images discovered close to the giant cD galaxy in the lensing cluster Abell 2218 (z=0.18) during a systematic survey for highly magnified star-forming galaxies beyond z=5. A well-constrained mass model suggests the pair arises via a gravitationally lensed source viewed at high magnification. Keck spectroscopy confirms the lensing hypothesis and implies that the unlensed source is a very faint (I~30), compact (<150 h-165 pc), and isolated object at z=5.576 whose optical emission is substantially contained within the Lyalpha emission line; no stellar continuum is detectable. The available data suggest the source is a promising candidate for an isolated ~106 Msolar system seen producing its first generation of stars close to the epoch of reionization.

	Abstract = {The cluster CL 1358+62 displays a prominent red arc in WFPC2 images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Keck spectra of the arc show Lyalpha emission at 7204 {\AA}, a continuum drop blueward of the line, and several absorption lines to the red. We identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a redshift of z = 4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A gravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift galaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a patch of extended emission 0.4" from the knot. The effective radius of the bright knot is 0.022" or 130 h-150 pc. The extended patch is partially resolved into compact regions of star formation. The reconstructed galaxy has IAB = 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3 × 1011 Lsolar. This can be produced by a star formation rate of 36 h-250 Msolar yr-1 (q0 = 0.5) or by an instantaneous starburst of 3 × 108 Msolar. The spectral lines show velocity variations on the order of 300 km s-1 along the arc. The Si II line is blueshifted with respect to the Lyalpha emission, and the Lyalpha emission line is asymmetric with a red tail. These spectral features are naturally explained by an outflow model, in which the blue side of the Lyalpha line has been absorbed by outflowing neutral H I. Evidence from other sources indicates that outflows are common in starburst galaxies at high and low redshift. We have discovered a companion galaxy with a radial velocity only 450 km s-1 different than that of the arc. The serendipitous discovery of these two galaxies suggests that systematic searches may uncover galaxies at even higher redshifts.  Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and observations obtained at the W.

	Abstract = {Using deep Keck spectroscopy of Lyman break galaxies selected from infrared imaging data taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope, we present new evidence for a reversal in the redshift-dependent fraction of star-forming galaxies with detectable Lyman alpha (Lyalpha) emission in the redshift range 6.3 < z < 8.8. Our earlier surveys with the DEIMOS spectrograph demonstrated a significant increase with redshift in the fraction of line emitting galaxies over the interval 4 < z < 6, particularly for intrinsically faint systems which dominate the luminosity density. Using the longer wavelength sensitivities of Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and NIRSPEC, we have targeted 19 Lyman break galaxies selected using recent WFC3/IR data whose photometric redshifts are in the range 6.3 < z < 8.8 and which span a wide range of intrinsic luminosities. Our spectroscopic exposures typically reach a 5sigma sensitivity of <50 {\AA} for the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of Lyalpha emission. Despite the high fraction of emitters seen only a few hundred million years later, we find only two convincing and one possible line emitter in our more distant sample. Combining with published data on a further seven sources obtained using FORS2 on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and assuming continuity in the trends found at lower redshift, we discuss the significance of this apparent reversal in the redshift-dependent Lyalpha fraction in the context of our range in continuum luminosity. Assuming all the targeted sources are at their photometric redshift and our assumptions about the Lyalpha EW distribution are correct, we would expect to find so few emitters in less than 1% of the realizations drawn from our lower redshift samples. Our new results provide further support for the suggestion that, at the redshifts now being probed spectroscopically, we are entering the era where the intergalactic medium is partially neutral. With the arrival of more sensitive multi-slit infrared spectrographs, the prospects for improving the statistical validity of this result are promising.},

	Abstract = {We present adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy around the Ha or Hb lines of 12 gravitationally lensed galaxies obtained with VLT/SINFONI, Keck/OSIRIS and Gemini/NIFS. We combine these data with previous observations and investigate the dynamics and star formation properties of 17 lensed galaxies at z = 1-4. Thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4 - 90x by foreground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40 - 700 pc are achieved. The magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates and stellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies feature dust-corrected SFRs derived from Ha or Hb emission of 0.8 - 40Msol/yr, and stellar masses M* ~ 4e8 - 6e10 Msol. All of the galaxies have velocity gradients, with 59% consistent with being rotating discs and a likely merger fraction of 29%, with the remaining 12% classed as 'undetermined.' We extract 50 star-forming clumps with sizes in the range 60pc - 1kpc from the Ha (or Hb) maps, and find that their surface brightnesses and their characteristic luminosities evolve to higher luminosities with redshift. We show that this evolution can be described by fragmentation on larger scales in gas-rich discs, and is likely to be driven by evolving gas fractions.},

	Abstract = {Context: Massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift can magnify the flux of distant background sources by several magnitudes.   Aims: We exploit this effect to search for lensed distant supernovae that may otherwise be too faint to be detected.  Methods: A supernova search was conducted at near infrared wavelengths using the ISAAC instrument at the VLT. The massive galaxy clusters Abell 1689, Abell 1835, and AC114 were observed for a total of 20 h to search for supernovae in gravitationally magnified background galaxies. The observations were split into individual epochs of 2 h of exposure time, separated by approximately one month. Image-subtraction techniques were used to search for transient objects with light curve properties consistent with supernovae, both in our new and archival ISAAC/VLT data. The limiting magnitude of the individual epochs was estimated by adding artificial stars to the subtracted images. Most of the epochs reach 90% detection efficiency at SZ(J) ~= 23.8-24.0 mag (Vega).   Results: Two transient objects, both in archival images of Abell 1689 and AC114, were detected. The transient in AC114 coincides - within the position uncertainty - with an X-ray source and is likely to be a variable AGN at the cluster redshift. The transient in Abell 1689 was found at SZ = 23.24 mag, ~0.5´´away from a galaxy with photometric redshift z_gal = 0.6 $\pm$ 0.15. The light curves and the colors of the transient are consistent with a reddened type IIP supernova at redshift z = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05. The lensing model of Abell 1689 predicts ~1.4 mag of magnification at the position of the transient, making it the most magnified supernova ever found and only the second supernova found behind a galaxy cluster. Conclusions: Our pilot survey has demonstrated the feasibility to find distant gravitationally magnified supernovae behind massive galaxy clusters. One likely supernova was found behind Abell 1689, in accordance with the expectations for this survey, as shown in an accompanying analysis paper.  Based on observations made  with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory  under program IDs 079.A-0192 and 081.A-0734.},

@article{Kneib:2004,
	Abstract = {We discuss the observational properties of a remarkably faint triply imaged galaxy revealed in a deep z'-band Advanced Camera for Surveys observation of the lensing cluster A2218 (z=0.175). A well-constrained mass model for the cluster, which incorporates the outcome of recent Keck spectroscopic campaigns, suggests that the triple system arises via a high-redshift (z>6) source viewed at high magnification (~=25 times). Optical and infrared photometry from Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory confirms the lensing hypothesis and suggests that a significant discontinuity occurs in the spectral energy distribution within the wavelength interval 9250-9850 {\AA}. If this break is associated with Gunn-Peterson absorption from neutral hydrogen, a redshift of 6.6<z<7.1 is inferred. Deep Keck spectroscopy conducted using both optical and infrared spectrographs fails to reveal any prominent emission lines in this region. However, an infrared stellar continuum is detected whose decline below 9800 {\AA} suggests a spectroscopic redshift toward the upper end of the range constrained photometrically, i.e., z~=7. Regardless of the precise redshift, the source is remarkably compact (<~1 h-170 kpc) and faint (zF850LP=28.0) yet is undergoing vigorous star formation at a rate ~=2.6 Msolar yr-1. An intriguing property is the steep slope of the ultraviolet continuum implied by the photometry, which may suggest that the source is representative of an early population of galaxies responsible for cosmic reionization. Independent verification of these results is highly desirable, but our attempts highlight the difficulty of studying such sources with present facilities and the challenges faced in pushing back the frontiers of the observable universe beyond z~6.5.  Using data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, operated by AURA, Inc., for NASA and the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The W.M. Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M.

@article{Sullivan:2000,
	Abstract = {Distant Type Ia and II supernovae (SNe) can serve as valuable probes of the history of the cosmic expansion and star formation, and provide important information on their progenitor models. At present, however, there are few observational constraints on the abundance of SNe at high redshifts. A major science driver for the Next Generation Space Telescope is the study of such very distant SNe. In this paper we discuss strategies for finding and counting distant SNe by using repeat imaging of supercritical intermediate redshift clusters whose mass distributions are well constrained via modelling of strongly lensed features. For a variety of different models for the star formation history and supernova progenitors, we estimate the likelihood of detecting lensed SNe as a function of their redshift. In the case of a survey conducted with Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we predict a high probability of seeing a supernova in a single return visit with either Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 or Advanced Camera for Surveys, and a much higher probability of detecting examples with rho(r) = (sigmanu2)/(2piGr2), z>1 in the lensed case. Most events would represent magnified SNe II at M(r) = (2sigmanu2)/G, z~=1, and a fraction will be more distant examples. We discuss various ways to classify such events using ground-based infrared photometry. We demonstrate an application of the method using the HST archival data and discuss the case of a possible event found in the rich cluster AC114 rho(r) = [(rhocdeltac)/(rrs)(1 + rrs)2, (z=0.31).},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of galaxies ~2-3Gyr after the Big Bang have revealed large, rotating disks, similar to those of galaxies today. The existence of well-ordered rotation in galaxies during this peak epoch of cosmic star formation indicates that gas accretion is likely to be the dominant mode by which galaxies grow, because major mergers of galaxies would completely disrupt the observed velocity fields. But poor spatial resolution and sensitivity have hampered this interpretation; such studies have been limited to the largest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally different modes of assembly from those of more typical galaxies (which are thought to grow into the spheroidal components at the centres of galaxies similar to the Milky Way). Here we report observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at z = 3.07, with a linear resolution of ~100parsecs. We find a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted efficiently into stars, likely to be assembling a spheroidal bulge similar to those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day. The presence of undisrupted rotation may indicate that galaxies such as the Milky Way gain much of their mass by accretion rather than major mergers.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved dynamics for six strongly lensed star-forming galaxies at z = 1.7-3.1, each enlarged by a linear magnification factor of ~×8. Using the Keck laser guide star AO system and the OH-Suppressing Infra-Red Imaging Spectrograph integral field unit spectrograph, we resolve kinematic and morphological detail in our sample with an unprecedented fidelity, in some cases achieving spatial resolutions of ~=100pc. With one exception our sources have diameters ranging from 1 to 7 kpc, integrated star formation rates of 2-40Msolaryr-1 (uncorrected for extinction) and dynamical masses of 109.7-10.3Msolar. With this exquisite resolution, we find that four of the six galaxies display coherent velocity fields consistent with a simple rotating disc model. Our model fits imply ratios for the systemic to random motion, Vc sini/sigma, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 and Toomre disc parameters Q < 1. The large fraction of well-ordered velocity fields in our sample is consistent with data analysed for larger, more luminous sources at this redshift. We demonstrate that the apparent contradiction with earlier dynamical results published for unlensed compact sources arises from the considerably improved spatial resolution and sampling uniquely provided by the combination of adaptive optics and strong gravitational lensing. Our high-resolution data further reveal that all six galaxies contain multiple giant star-forming HII regions whose resolved diameters are in the range 300 pc to 1.0 kpc, consistent with the Jeans length expected in the case of dispersion support. From the kinematic data, we calculate that these regions have dynamical masses of 108.8-9.5Msolar, also in agreement with local data. However, the density of star formation in these regions is ~100× higher than observed in local spirals; such high values are only seen in the most luminous local starbursts. The global dynamics and demographics of star formation in these HII regions suggest that vigorous star formation is primarily governed by gravitational instability in primitive rotating discs. The physical insight provided by the combination of adaptive optics and gravitational lensing suggests it will be highly valuable to locate many more strongly lensed distant galaxies with high star formation rates before the era of the next-generation ground-based telescopes when such observations will become routine.},

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared imaging spectroscopy of the strongly lensed z = 2.00 galaxy SDSS J120601.69+514227.8 ("the Clone arc"). Using OSIRIS on the Keck 2 telescope with laser guide star adaptive optics, we achieve resolved spectroscopy with 0.20 arcsec FWHM resolution in the diagnostic emission lines [O III], Halpha, and [N II]. The lensing magnification allows us to map the velocity and star formation from Halpha emission at a physical resolution of sime300 pc in the galaxy source plane. With an integrated star formation rate of sime50 M sun yr-1, the galaxy is typical of sources similarly studied at this epoch. It is dispersion dominated with a velocity gradient of sime$\pm$80 km s-1 and average dispersion \bar{sigma} = 85 km s-1 the dynamical mass is 2.4 × 1010 M sun within a half-light radius of 2.9 kpc. Robust detection of [N II] emission across the entire OSIRIS field of view enables us to trace the gas phase metallicity distribution with 500 pc resolution. We find a strong radial gradient in both the [N II]/Halpha and [O III]/Halpha ratios indicating a metallicity gradient of -0.27 $\pm$ 0.05 dex kpc-1 with central metallicity close to solar. We demonstrate that the gradient is seen independently in two multiple images. While the physical gradient is considerably steeper than that observed in local galaxies, in terms of the effective radius at that epoch, the gradient is similar. This suggests that subsequent growth occurs in an inside-out manner with the inner metallicity gradient diminished over time due to radial mixing and enrichment from star formation.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained deep ultraviolet imaging of the lensing cluster A1689 with the WFC3/UVIS camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W (30 orbits) and F336W (4 orbits) filters. These images are used to identify z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies via their Lyman break, in the same manner that galaxies are typically selected at z >= 3. Because of the unprecedented depth of the images and the large magnification provided by the lensing cluster, we detect galaxies 100× fainter than previous surveys at this redshift. After removing all multiple images, we have 58 galaxies in our sample in the range -19.5 < M 1500 < -13 AB mag. Because the mass distribution of A1689 is well constrained, we are able to calculate the intrinsic sensitivity of the observations as a function of source plane position, allowing for accurate determinations of effective volume as a function of luminosity. We fit the faint-end slope of the luminosity function to be alpha = -1.74 $\pm$ 0.08, which is consistent with the values obtained for 2.5 < z < 6. Notably, there is no turnover in the luminosity function down to M 1500 = -13 AB mag. We fit the UV spectral slopes with photometry from existing Hubble optical imaging. The observed trend of increasingly redder slopes with luminosity at higher redshifts is observed in our sample, but with redder slopes at all luminosities and average reddening of langE(B - V)rang = 0.15 mag. We assume the stars in these galaxies are metal poor (0.2 Z &sun;) compared to their brighter counterparts (Z &sun;), resulting in bluer assumed intrinsic UV slopes and larger derived values for dust extinction. The total UV luminosity density at z ~ 2 is 4.31^{+0.68}_{-0.60} \times 10^{26} erg s-1 Hz-1 Mpc-3, more than 70% of which is emitted by galaxies in the luminosity range of our sample. Finally, we determine the global star formation rate density from UV-selected galaxies at z ~ 2 (assuming a constant dust extinction correction of 4.2 over all luminosities and a Kroupa initial mass function) of 0.148^{+0.023}_{-0.020} M &sun; yr-1 Mpc-3, significantly higher than previous determinations because of the additional population of fainter galaxies and the larger dust correction factors.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {We present the first metallicity gradient measurement for a grand-design face-on spiral galaxy at z ~ 1.5. This galaxy has been magnified by a factor of 22× by a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 at z = 0.544. Using the Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics aided integral field spectrograph OSIRIS on KECK II, we target the Halpha emission and achieve a spatial resolution of 0farcs1, corresponding to a source-plane resolution of 170 pc. The galaxy has well-developed spiral arms and the nebular emission line dynamics clearly indicate a rotationally supported disk with V rot/sigma ~ 4. The best-fit disk velocity field model yields a maximum rotation of V rotsin i = 150 $\pm$ 15 km s-1, and a dynamical mass of M dyn = (1.3 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1010 cosec2(i) M sun (within 2.5 kpc), where the inclination angle i = 45$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 10$\,^{\circ}$. Based on the [N II] and Halpha ratios, we measured the radial chemical abundance gradient from the inner hundreds of parsecs out to ~5 kpc. The slope of the gradient is -0.16 $\pm$ 0.02 dex kpc-1, significantly steeper than the gradient of late-type or early-type galaxies in the local universe. If representative of disk galaxies at z ~ 1.5, our results support an "inside-out" disk formation scenario in which early infall/collapse in the galaxy center builds a chemically enriched nucleus, followed by slow enrichment of the disk over the next 9 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive observational study of the gas-phase metallicity of star-forming galaxies from z ~ 0 --> 3. We combine our new sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies with existing lensed and non-lensed samples to conduct a large investigation into the mass-metallicity (MZ) relation at z > 1. We apply a self-consistent metallicity calibration scheme to investigate the metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift. The lensing magnification ensures that our sample spans an unprecedented range of stellar mass (3 × 107 to 6 × 1010 M &sun;). We find that at the median redshift of z = 2.07, the median metallicity of the lensed sample is 0.35 dex lower than the local SDSS star-forming galaxies and 0.18 dex lower than the z ~ 0.8 DEEP2 galaxies. We also present the z ~ 2 MZ relation using 19 lensed galaxies. A more rapid evolution is seen between z ~ 1 --> 3 than z ~ 0 --> 1 for the high-mass galaxies (109.5 M &sun; < M sstarf < 1011 M &sun;), with almost twice as much enrichment between z ~ 1 --> 3 than between z ~ 1 --> 0. We compare this evolution with the most recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with momentum-driven winds. We find that the model metallicity is consistent with the observed metallicity within the observational error for the low-mass bins. However, for higher masses, the model overpredicts the metallicity at all redshifts. The overprediction is most significant in the highest mass bin of 1010-1011 M &sun;.},

	Abstract = {Context. The identification and study of the first galaxies remains one of the most exciting topics in observational cosmology. The determination of the best possible observing strategies is a very important choice in order to build up a representative sample of spectroscopically confirmed sources at high-z (z ⪆ 7), beyond the limits of present-day observations.  Aims: This paper is intended to precisely adress the relative efficiency of lensing and blank fields in the identification and study of galaxies at 6 ⪅ z ⪅ 12.  Methods: The detection efficiency and field-to-field variance are estimated from direct simulations of both blank and lensing fields observations. Present known luminosity functions in the UV are used to determine the expected distribution and properties of distant samples at z ⪆ 6 for a variety of survey configurations. Different models for well known lensing clusters are used to simulate in details the magnification and dilution effects on the backgound distant population of galaxies.  Results: The presence of a strong-lensing cluster along the line of sight has a dramatic effect on the number of observed sources, with a positive magnification bias in typical ground-based ``shallow'' surveys (AB ⪅ 25.5). The positive magnification bias increases with the redshift of sources and decreases with both depth of the survey and the size of the surveyed area. The maximum efficiency is reached for lensing clusters at z ~ 0.1-0.3. Observing blank fields in shallow surveys is particularly inefficient as compared to lensing fields if the UV LF for LBGs is strongly evolving at z ⪆ 7. Also in this case, the number of z >= 8 sources expected at the typical depth of JWST (AB ~ 28-29) is much higher in lensing than in blank fields (e.g. a factor of ~10 for AB ⪅ 28). All these results have been obtained assuming that number counts derived in clusters are not dominated by sources below the limiting surface brightness of observations, which in turn depends on the reliability of the usual scalings applied to the size of high-z sources.  Conclusions: Blank field surveys with a large field of view are needed to prove the bright end of the LF at z ⪆ 6-7, whereas lensing clusters are particularly useful for exploring the mid to faint end of the LF.},

	Abstract = {We conduct a search for z gsim 7 dropout galaxies behind 11 massive lensing clusters using 21 arcmin2 of deep Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS, ACS, and WFPC2 image data. In total, over this entire area, we find only one robust z ~ 7 z-dropout candidate (previously reported around Abell 1689). Four less robust z-dropout and J-dropout candidates are also found. The nature of the four weaker candidates could not be precisely determined due to the limited depth of the available optical data, but detailed simulations suggest that all four are likely to be low-redshift interlopers. By contrast, we estimate that our robust candidate A1689-zD1 has <0.2% probability of being a low-redshift interloper. We compare these numbers with what we might expect using the z ~ 7 UV luminosity function (LF) determined from field searches. We predict 2.7 z ~ 7 z-dropouts and 0.3 z ~ 9 J-dropouts over our cluster search area, in reasonable agreement with our observational results, given the small numbers. The number of z gsim 7 candidates we find in the present search is much lower than that which has been reported in several previous studies of the prevalence of z gsim 7 galaxies behind lensing clusters. To understand these differences, we examined z gsim 7 candidates in other studies and conclude that only a small fraction are likely to be z gsim 7 galaxies. Our findings support models that show that gravitational lensing from clusters is of the most value for detecting galaxies at magnitudes brighter than L* (H lsim 27) where the LF is expected to be very steep. Use of these clusters to constrain the faint-end slope or determine the full LF is likely of less value due to the shallower effective slope measured for the LF at fainter magnitudes, as well as significant uncertainties introduced from modeling both the gravitational lensing and incompleteness.

@article{Wong:2011,
	Abstract = {Using new photometric and spectroscopic data in the fields of nine strong gravitational lenses that lie in galaxy groups, we analyze the effects of both the local group environment and line-of-sight (LOS) galaxies on the lens potential. We use Monte Carlo simulations to derive the shear directly from measurements of the complex lens environment, providing the first detailed independent check of the shear obtained from lens modeling. We account for possible tidal stripping of the group galaxies by varying the fraction of total mass apportioned between the group dark matter halo and individual group galaxies. The environment produces an average shear of gamma = 0.08 (ranging from 0.02 to 0.17), significant enough to affect quantities derived from lens observables. However, the direction and magnitude of the shears do not match those obtained from lens modeling in three of the six four-image systems in our sample (B1422, RXJ1131, and WFI2033). The source of this disagreement is not clear, implying that the assumptions inherent in both the environment and lens model approaches must be reconsidered. If only the local group environment of the lens is included, the average shear is gamma = 0.05 (ranging from 0.01 to 0.14), indicating that LOS contributions to the lens potential are not negligible. We isolate the effects of various theoretical and observational uncertainties on our results. Of those uncertainties, the scatter in the Faber-Jackson relation and error in the group centroid position dominate. Future surveys of lens environments should prioritize spectroscopic sampling of both the local lens environment and objects along the LOS, particularly those bright (I< 21.5) galaxies projected within 5' of the lens.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

@article{Bayliss:2014,
	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the line-of-sight structure toward a sample of 10 strong lensing cluster cores. Structure is traced by groups that are identified spectroscopically in the redshift range, 0.1 <= z <= 0.9, and we measure the projected angular and comoving separations between each group and the primary strong lensing clusters in each corresponding line of sight. From these data we measure the distribution of projected angular separations between the primary strong lensing clusters and uncorrelated large-scale structure as traced by groups. We then compare the observed distribution of angular separations for our strong lensing selected lines of sight against the distribution of groups that is predicted for clusters lying along random lines of sight. There is clear evidence for an excess of structure along the line of sight at small angular separations (theta <= 6') along the strong lensing selected lines of sight, indicating that uncorrelated structure is a significant systematic that contributes to producing galaxy clusters with large cross sections for strong lensing. The prevalence of line-of-sight structure is one of several biases in strong lensing clusters that can potentially be folded into cosmological measurements using galaxy cluster samples. These results also have implications for current and future studies---such as the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields---that make use of massive galaxy cluster lenses as precision cosmological telescopes; it is essential that the contribution of line-of-sight structure be carefully accounted for in the strong lens modeling of the cluster lenses.

	Abstract = {Galaxies acting as gravitational lenses are surrounded by, at most, a handful of images. This apparent paucity of information forces one to make the best possible use of what information is available to invert the lens system. In this paper, we explore the use of a genetic algorithm to invert in a non-parametric way strong lensing systems containing only a small number of images. Perhaps the most important conclusion of this paper is that it is possible to infer the mass distribution of such gravitational lens systems using a non-parametric technique. We show that including information about the null space (i.e. the region where no images are found) is prerequisite to avoid the prediction of a large number of spurious images, and to reliably reconstruct the lens mass density. While the total mass of the lens is usually constrained within a few per cent, the fidelity of the reconstruction of the lens mass distribution depends on the number and position of the images. The technique employed to include null space information can be extended in a straightforward way to add additional constraints, such as weak-lensing data or time-delay information.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically derived stellar mass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z < 0.65; median z= 0.2) galaxies in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic redshift survey. These masses, as well as the full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public as part of GAMA data release 2. Although the GAMA database does include near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based on optical data alone. We use generic properties of stellar population synthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle a very good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, M*/Li. Further, we use the observed relation between restframe (g-i) and M*/Li for real GAMA galaxies to argue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves, (g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate M*/Li to an accuracy of ≲0.1 dex (1sigma). This 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-M*/Li relation offers a simple and transparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimal data, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their results to z≲0.4 measurements from GAMA.},

	Abstract = {Some recent observations provide >2sigma evidence for phantom dark energy---a value of the dark energy equation of state less than the cosmological-constant value of -1. We focus on constraining the equation of state by combining current data from the most mature geometrical probes of dark energy: type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), the Supernova Cosmology Project (Union2.1), and the Pan-STARRS1 survey (PS1); cosmic microwave background measurements from Planck and WMAP9; and a combination of measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. The combined data are consistent with w=-1 for the Union2.1 sample, though they present moderate (˜1.9sigma) evidence for a phantom value when either the SNLS3 or PS1 sample is used instead. We study the dependence of the constraints on the redshift, stretch, color, and host galaxy stellar mass of SNe, but we find no unusual trends. In contrast, the constraints strongly depend on any external H0 prior: a higher adopted value for the direct measurement of the Hubble constant (H0≳71 km/s/Mpc) leads to ≳2sigma evidence for phantom dark energy. Given Planck data, we can therefore make the following statement at 2sigma confidence: either the SNLS3 and PS1 data have systematics that remain unaccounted for or the Hubble constant is below 71 km/s/Mpc; else the dark energy equation of state is indeed phantom.},

	Abstract = {Time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain the mass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. We here present an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sources behind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models. We find that for time delays less than 1000 days, at z = 3.0, their logarithmic probability distribution functions are well represented by P(log Deltat) = 5.3 × 10-4Deltattilde beta/M2502tilde beta, with tilde beta = 0.77, where M250 is the projected cluster mass inside 250 kpc (in 1014M&sun;), and tilde beta is the power-law slope of the distribution. The resultant probability distribution function enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing cluster of known mass. For a cluster with M250 = 2 × 1014M&sun;, the fraction of time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3%. Taking Abell 1689 as an example, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity dispersions sigma>=500kms-1, mainly produce large time delays, while galaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. We estimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in the known images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of estimating the supernova rate is applied in this work. For a magnitude threshold of mAB = 26.5, the yearly rate of Type Ia (core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than 1000 days is 0.004$\pm$0.002 (0.029$\pm$0.001). If the magnitude threshold is lowered to mAB ~ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for time delay observation is 0.044$\pm$0.015 per year.},

@article{Schneider:2014,
	Abstract = {The main obstacle that gravitational lensing has in determining accurate masses of deflectors, or in determining precise estimates for the Hubble constant, is the degeneracy of lensing observables with respect to the mass-sheet transformation (MST). The MST is a global modification of the mass distribution which leaves all image positions, shapes, and flux ratios invariant, but which changes the time delay. Here we show that another global transformation of lensing mass distributions exists which leaves image positions and flux ratios almost invariant, and of which the MST is a special case. As is the case for the MST, this new transformation only applies if one considers only those source components that are at the same distance from us. Whereas for axi-symmetric lenses this source position transformation exactly reproduces all strong lensing observables, it does so only approximately for more general lens situations. We provide crude estimates for the accuracy with which the transformed mass distribution can reproduce the same image positions as the original lens model, and present an illustrative example of its performance. This new invariance transformation is most likely the reason why the same strong lensing information can be accounted for with rather different mass models.},

@article{Kessler:2013,
	Abstract = {For spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae we evaluate models of intrinsic brightness variations with detailed data/Monte Carlo comparisons of the dispersion in the following quantities: Hubble-diagram scatter, color difference (B - V - c) between the true B - V color and the fitted color (c) from the SALT-II light curve model, and photometric redshift residual. The data sample includes 251 ugriz light curves from the three-season Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II and 191 griz light curves from the Supernova Legacy Survey 3 year data release. We find that the simplest model of a wavelength-independent (coherent) scatter is not adequate, and that to describe the data the intrinsic-scatter model must have wavelength-dependent variations resulting in a ~0.02 mag scatter in B - V - c. Relatively weak constraints are obtained on the nature of intrinsic scatter because a variety of different models can reasonably describe this photometric data sample. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the standard approach of adding a coherent-scatter term in quadrature to the distance-modulus uncertainty in order to bring the reduced chi2 to unity when fitting a Hubble diagram. If the light curve fits include model uncertainties with the correct wavelength dependence of the scatter, we find that this approach is valid and that the bias on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w is much smaller (~0.001) than current systematic uncertainties. However, incorrect model uncertainties can lead to a significant bias on the distance moduli, with up to ~0.05 mag redshift-dependent variation. This bias is roughly reduced in half after applying a Malmquist bias correction. For the recent SNLS3 cosmology results, we estimate that this effect introduces an additional systematic uncertainty on w of ~0.02, well below the total uncertainty. This uncertainty depends on the choice of viable scatter models and the choice of supernova (SN) samples, and thus this small w-uncertainty is not guaranteed in future cosmology results. For example, the w-uncertainty for SDSS+SNLS (dropping the nearby SNe) increases to ~0.04.},

	Abstract = {We use simulated type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples, including both photometry and spectra, to perform the first direct validation of cosmology analysis using the SALT-II light curve model. This validation includes residuals from the light curve training process, systematic biases in SN Ia distance measurements, and a bias on the dark energy equation of state parameter w. Using the SN-analysis package SNANA, we simulate and analyze realistic samples corresponding to the data samples used in the SNLS3 analysis: ~120 low-redshift (z < 0.1) SNe Ia, ~255 Sloan Digital Sky Survey SNe Ia (z < 0.4), and ~290 SNLS SNe Ia (z <= 1). To probe systematic uncertainties in detail, we vary the input spectral model, the model of intrinsic scatter, and the smoothing (i.e., regularization) parameters used during the SALT-II model training. Using realistic intrinsic scatter models results in a slight bias in the ultraviolet portion of the trained SALT-II model, and w biases (w input - w recovered) ranging from -0.005 $\pm$ 0.012 to -0.024 $\pm$ 0.010. These biases are indistinguishable from each other within the uncertainty; the average bias on w is -0.014 $\pm$ 0.007.},

@article{Stickel:2002,
	Abstract = {The ISOPHOT instrument aboard ISO has been used to observe extended FIR emission of six Abell clusters. Strip scanning measurements with crossing position angles centered on the clusters were carried out at 120 mu m and 180 mu m. The raw profiles of the I120 mu m/I180 mu m surface brightness ratio including zodiacal light show a bump towards Abell 1656 (Coma), dips towards Abell 262 and Abell 2670, and are without clear structure towards Abell 400, Abell 496, and Abell 4038. After subtraction of the zodiacal light, the bump towards Abell 1656 is still present, while the dips towards Abell 262 and Abell 2670 are no longer noticable. This indicates a localized excess of emitting material outside the Galaxy towards Abell 1656 with properties different from the galactic foreground cirrus, while the behavior in Abell 262 and Abell 2670 can be reconciled with galactic cirrus structures localized on the line-of-sight to these clusters. The excess of ≈0.2 MJy/sr seen at 120 mu m towards Abell 1656 (Coma) is interpreted as being due to thermal emission from intracluster dust distributed in the hot X-ray emitting intracluster medium. The integrated excess flux within the central region of 10 arcmin--15 arcmin diameter is ≈2.8 Jy. Since the dust temperature is poorly constrained, only a rough estimate of the associated dust mass of MD ≈ 107 Msolar can be derived. The associated visual extinction is negligible (AV << 0.1 mag) and much smaller than claimed from optical observations. No evidence is found for intracluster dust in the other five clusters observed. The absence of any signature for intracluster dust in five clusters and the rather low inferred dust mass in Abell 1656 indicates that intracluster dust is likely not responsible for the excess X-ray absorption seen in cooling flow clusters. These observations thereby represent a further unsuccessful attempt in detecting the presumed final stage of the cooling flow material, in accord with quite a number of previous studies in other wavelengths regions. Finally, the observed dimming of the high-redshift supernovae is unlikely be attributable to extinction caused by dust in the intracluster or even a presumed intercluster medium. Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands and the UK) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

	Abstract = {We have searched for IR emission from the intracluster dust (ICD) in the galaxy cluster A2029. Weak signals of enhanced extended emission in the cluster are detected at 24 and 70 mum. However, the signals are indistinguishable from the foreground fluctuations. The 24 mum versus 70 mum color map does not discriminate the dust emission in the cluster from the cirrus emission. After excluding the contamination from the point sources, we obtain upper limits for the extended ICD emission in A2029, 5×103 Jy sr-1 at 24 mum and 5×104 Jy sr-1 at 70 mum. The upper limits are generally consistent with the expectation from theoretical calculations and support a dust deficiency in the cluster compared to the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. Our results suggest that even with the much improved sensitivity of current IR telescopes, a clear detection of the IR emission from ICD may be difficult due to cirrus noise.},

	Abstract = {We present a simultaneous detection of gravitational magnification and dust reddening effects due to galactic haloes and large-scale structure. The measurement is based on correlating the brightness of ~85000 quasars at z > 1 with the position of 24 million galaxies at z ~ 0.3 derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and is used to constrain the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust correlation functions up to cosmological scales.  The presence of dust is detected from 20 kpc to several Mpc, and we find its projected density to follow: Sigmadust ~ r-0.8p, a distribution similar to mass. On large scales, its wavelength dependence is described by RV ~= 4.9 +/- 3.2, consistent with interstellar dust. This, in turn, implies a cosmic dust density of Omegadust ~= 5 × 10-6, roughly half of which comes from dust in haloes of ~L* galaxies. We estimate the resulting opacity of the Universe for various evolutionary models and find <AV > ~ 0.03 mag up to z = 0.5.  We present magnification measurements, corrected for dust extinction, from which the galaxy-mass correlation function is inferred to give the mean surface mass density profile around galaxies Sigma ~ 30(theta /1 arcmin)-0.8h Msolar pc-2 up to a radius of 10 Mpc, in agreement with gravitational shear estimates.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) measurements have become a key ingredient in current determinations of cosmological parameters. These sources can however be used as standard candles only after correcting their apparent brightness for a number of effects. In this paper, we discuss some limitations imposed by the formalism currently used for such corrections and investigate the impact on cosmological constraints. We show that colour corrections are, in general, expected to be biased. In addition, colour excesses which do not add a significant scatter to the observed SN brightnesses affect the value of cosmological parameters but leave the slope of the colour-luminosity relation unchanged. We quantify these biases in the context of the redshift-dependent dust extinction suggested by the recent detection of intergalactic dust by M{\'e}nard et al. Using a range of models for the opacity of the Universe as a function of redshift, we find that colour-magnitude-stretch scaling relations are virtually insensitive to the presence of cosmic dust while cosmological parameters such as OmegaM and w are biased at the level of a few per cent, i.e. offsets comparable to the current statistical errors. Future surveys will be able to limit the impact of intergalactic extinction by observing at longer wavelengths. In addition, such data sets will provide direct detections of intergalactic dust by cross-correlating SN colours and the density of foreground galaxies, which can be used as a consistency check on the cosmic dust extinction correction. Alternatively, such biases could be avoided by correcting the colours of SNe on an object-by-object basis with accurate photometry.},

	Abstract = {With the advent of large, deep surveys, the observation of a strongly gravitationally lensed supernova becomes increasingly likely. High-redshift surveys continue apace, with a handful of Type Ia supernovae observed to date at redshifts of 1 or greater. In addition, a satellite has been proposed (the Supernova/Acceleration Probe [SNAP]) that will be dedicated to observing thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply imaged supernova from ongoing surveys, we find that SNAP would observe at least eight such events per year. Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP's large sample of Type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image separations, and relative image magnifications, and the SNAP strong-lensing database will offer measures of Omegam, OmegaLambda, and H0, independent of SNAP's primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density profiles of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed Type Ia supernovae afford us the opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {Context. Weak lensing is one of the most readily available diagnostic tools to measure the total density profiles of distant clusters of galaxies. Unfortunately, it suffers from the well-known mass-sheet degeneracy, so that weak lensing analyses cannot lead to fully reliable determinations of the total mass of the clusters. One possible way to set the relevant scale of the density profile would be to make a direct measurement of the magnification produced by the clusters as gravitational lenses; in the past, this objective has been addressed in a number of ways, but with no significant success.  Aims: We revisit a suggestion made a few years ago for this general purpose, based on the use of the fundamental plane as a standard rod for early-type galaxies. Here we move one step further, beyond the simple outline of the idea given earlier, and quantify some statistical properties of this innovative diagnostic tool, with the final goal of identifying clear guidelines for a future observational test of concrete cases, which turns out to be well within the current instrument capabilities.  Methods: The study is carried out by discussing the statistical properties of fundamental plane measurements for a sample of early-type source galaxies behind a massive cluster, for which a weak lensing analysis is assumed to be available. Some general results are first obtained analytically and then tested and extended by means of dedicated simulations.  Results: We proceed with determining the optimal way of using fundamental plane measurements to determine the mass scale of a given cluster, which we find to be the study of a sample of early-type galaxies behind the cluster distributed approximately uniformly on the sky. We discuss the role of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies, in relation to the redshift of the lensing cluster and to the limitations of fundamental plane measurements. Simple simulations are carried out for clusters with intrinsic properties similar to those of the Coma cluster. We also show that, within a realistic cosmological scenario, substructures do not contribute much to the magnification signal that we are looking for, but add only a modest amount of scatter.  Conclusions: We find that for a massive cluster (M200 > 1015 M&sun;) located at redshift 0.3 $\pm$ 0.1, a set of about 20 fundamental plane measurements, combined with a robust weak lensing analysis, should be able to lead to a mass determination with a precision of 20% or better.},

@article{Bradac:2004,
	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is considered to be one of the most powerful tools to study the mass and the mass distribution of galaxy clusters. However, weak lensing mass reconstructions are plagued by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy - the surface mass density kappa of the cluster can be determined only up to a degeneracy transformation kappa -> kappa' = lambda kappa + (1 - lambda), where lambda is an arbitrary constant. This transformation fundamentally limits the accuracy of cluster mass determinations if no further assumptions are made. We describe here a method to break the mass-sheet degeneracy in weak lensing mass maps using the distortion and redshift information of background galaxies and illustrate this by two simple toy models. Compared to other techniques proposed in the past, it does not rely on any assumptions on cluster potential; it can be easily applied to non-parametric mass-reconstructions and no assumptions on boundary conditions have to be made. In addition it does not make use of weakly constrained information (such as the source number counts, used in the magnification effect). Our simulations show that we are effectively able to break the mass-sheet degeneracy for supercritical lenses, but that for undercritical lenses the mass-sheet degeneracy is very difficult to break, even under idealised conditions.},

	Abstract = {The images of a background source formed by a foreground mass distribution in a matter-dominated Friedmann cosmology are considered. A transformation is presented that leaves unchanged the image observables, including positions, relative magnifications, apparent luminosities, and differences in propagation times associated with image pairs. The observables are related to the parameters of the source and of a generalized lens model. The transformation is applied to these relations to scale the value of H(0) and to modify the mass distribution of the lens and move the position of the source. One lens model for Q0957 + 561 is discussed in the context of this transformation. The elliptical galaxy G1 is modelled as a singular isothermal sphere, and the light bending of the cluster is represented as a linear function of the impact parameter. It is shown that this model accounts for the positions and relative magnifications of images of Q0957 + 561 and yields a bound on H(0).},

	Abstract = {We present the local HII region metallicity near the site of the recently discovered multiply lensed supernova (SN; "SN Refsdal") at redshift 1.49. "SN Refsdal" is located at the outer spiral arm ($\sim$7 kpc) of the lensed host galaxy, which we have previously reported to exhibit a steep negative galactocentric metallicity gradient. Based on our updated near-infrared integral field spectroscopic data, the gas-phase metallicity averaged in an intrinsic radius of $\sim$ 550 pc surrounding an HII region $\sim$ 200 pc away from the SN site is 12 + log(O/H)$_{\rm PP04N2}$ $\le$ 8.67. The metallicity averaged over nine HII regions at similar galactocentric distances ($\sim$5-7 kpc) as "SN Refsdal" is constrained to be 12 + log(O/H)$_{\rm PP04N2}$ $\le$ 8.11. Given the fortuitous discovery of "SN Refsdal" in an advantageously lensed face-on spiral, this is the first observational constraint on the local metallicity environment of an SN site at redshift $z>1$.},

	Abstract = {A magnitude-limited redshift survey of galaxies having B magnitudes no fainter than 14.5, galactic latitudes no less than 40 deg, and nonnegative declinations is currently being undertaken. This paper presents in some detail the methods of data reduction, which are based on cross correlation against filtered templates. Expressions are presented for the uncertainty of a measured redshift, for the internal broadening of the object, and for the uncertainty of this broadening. Comparison of the optical data with previously published 21-cm data shows no systematic errors and yields excellent agreement with the internal error analysis. The method of analyzing velocity dispersions is quite promising for further application. A series of spectra are presented as examples to show the power and limitations of the correlation techniques.},

@article{Li:1998,
	Abstract = {Mergers of neutron stars (NS + NS) or neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes (NS + BH) eject a small fraction of matter with a subrelativistic velocity. Upon rapid decompression, nuclear-density medium condenses into neutron-rich nuclei, most of them radioactive. Radioactivity provides a long-term heat source for the expanding envelope. A brief transient has a peak luminosity in the supernova range, and the bulk of radiation in the UV-optical domain. We present a very crude model of the phenomenon, and simple analytical formulae that can be used to estimate the parameters of a transient as a function of poorly known input parameters. The mergers may be detected with high-redshift supernova searches as rapid transients, many of them far away from the parent galaxies. It is possible that the mysterious optical transients detected by Schmidt et al. are related to neutron star mergers, since they typically have no visible host galaxy.},

@article{Brammer:2012,
	Abstract = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ~7000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5, the epoch when ~60% of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625 arcmin2) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5sigma emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 mum at a spatial resolution of ~0farcs13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or sigma(v) ≈ 1000 km s-1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 12177 and 12328.},

	Abstract = {The deflection angles of lensed sources increase with their distance behind a given lens. We utilize this geometric effect to corroborate the z phot ~= 9.8 photometric redshift estimate of a faint near-IR dropout, triply imaged by the massive galaxy cluster A2744 in deep Hubble Frontier Fields images. The multiple images of this source follow the same symmetry as other nearby sets of multiple images that bracket the critical curves and have well-defined redshifts (up to z spec ~= 3.6), but with larger deflection angles, indicating that this source must lie at a higher redshift. Similarly, our different parametric and non-parametric lens models all require this object be at z >~ 4, with at least 95% confidence, thoroughly excluding the possibility of lower-redshift interlopers. To study the properties of this source, we correct the two brighter images for their magnifications, leading to a star formation rate of ~0.3 M &sun; yr-1, a stellar mass of ~4 × 107 M &sun;, and an age of <~ 220 Myr (95% confidence). The intrinsic apparent magnitude is 29.9 AB (F160W), and the rest-frame UV (~1500 {\AA}) absolute magnitude is M UV, AB = -17.6. This corresponds to {\sim }0.1\, L^{*}_{z=8} ({\sim }0.2 \,L^{*}_{z=10}, adopting dM*/dz ~ 0.45), making this candidate one of the least luminous galaxies discovered at z ~ 10.},

	Abstract = {Short-duration gamma-ray bursts are intense flashes of cosmic gamma-rays, lasting less than about two seconds, whose origin is unclear. The favoured hypothesis is that they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellar objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). This is supported by indirect evidence such as the properties of their host galaxies, but unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient, known as a `kilonova', in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity created by these heavy r-process elements. Here we report optical and near-infrared observations that provide strong evidence for such an event accompanying the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B. If this, the simplest interpretation of the data, is correct, then it confirms that compact-object mergers are the progenitors of short-duration gamma-ray bursts and the sites of significant production of r-process elements. It also suggests that kilonovae offer an alternative, unbeamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection of gravitational waves.},

	Abstract = {The vast majority of Type II supernovae (SNeII) are produced by red supergiants, but SN 1987A revealed that blue supergiants (BSGs) can produce members of this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. This best-studied event revolutionized our understanding of SNe and linking it to the bulk of Type II events is essential. We present here the optical photometry and spectroscopy gathered for SN 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard SNII and yet is not a SN 1987A analogue. The light curve of SN 2000cb is reminiscent of that of SN 1987A in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but on substantially different time-scales. Spectroscopically, SN 2000cb resembles a normal SNII, but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for SN 1987A or normal SNeII, above 18 000 km s-1 for Halpha at early times. The red colours, high velocities, late photometric peak and our modelling of this object all point towards a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of a small-radius star, most likely a BSG, producing 0.1 M&sun; of 56Ni. Adding a similar object to the sample, SN 2005ci, we derive a rate of ˜2 per cent of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of BSG explosions.},

	Abstract = {The currently favored model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) invokes explosions from the collapse of a massive star down to a black hole, either directly or through fallback. Those GRBs forming via fallback will produce much less radioactive nickel, and hence it has been argued (without any real calculation) that these systems produce dim supernovae. These fallback black hole GRBs have recently been argued as possible progenitors of a newly discovered set of GRBs lacking any associated supernovae. Here we present the first ever radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the light curves produced in the hypernova explosion by a delayed-fallback gamma-ray burst. We find that the bolometric light curve is dominated by shock-deposited energy, not the decay of radioactive elements. As such, observations of such bursts actually probe the density in the progenitor wind more than it does the production of radioactive nickel.},

	Abstract = {We present a revised lens model of MACS J1149+2223, in which the first resolved multiply imaged lensed supernova (SN) was discovered. The lens model is based on the model of Johnson et al. with some modifications. We include more lensing constraints from the host galaxy of the newly discovered SN, and increase the flexibility of the model in order to better reproduce the lensing signal in the vicinity of this galaxy. The revised model accurately reconstructs the positions of the lensed SN, provides magnifications, and predicts the time delay between the instances of the SN. Finally, we reconstruct the source image of the host galaxy, and position the SN on one of its spiral arms. Products of this lens model are available to the community through MAST.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision mass model of the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403, based on a strong-gravitational-lensing analysis of the recently acquired Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data. Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth provided by HST/Advanced Camera for Survey observations in three passbands, we identify 51 new multiply imaged galaxies, quadrupling the previous census and bringing the grand total to 68, comprising 194 individual lensed images. Having selected a subset of the 57 most securely identified multiply imaged galaxies, we use the LENSTOOL software package to constrain a lens model comprised of two cluster-scale dark-matter haloes and 98 galaxy-scale haloes. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms error of 0.68 arcsec, which constitutes an improvement of almost a factor of 2 over previous, pre-HFF models of this cluster. We find the total projected mass inside a 200 kpc aperture to be (1.60 $\pm$ 0.01) × 1014 M&sun;, a measurement that offers a three-fold improvement in precision, reaching the per cent level for the first time in any cluster. Finally, we quantify the increase in precision of the derived gravitational magnification of high-redshift galaxies and find an improvement by a factor of ˜2.5 in the statistical uncertainty. Our findings impressively confirm that HFF imaging has indeed opened the domain of high-precision mass measurements for massive clusters of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Aims: While weak lensing cannot resolve cluster cores and strong lensing is almost insensitive to density profiles outside the scale radius, combinations of both effects promise to constrain density profiles of galaxy clusters well, and thus to allow testing of the CDM expectation on dark-matter halo density profiles.  Methods: We develop an algorithm further that we had recently proposed for this purpose. It recovers a lensing potential optimally reproducing observations of both strong and weak-lensing effects by combining high resolution in cluster cores with the larger-scale information from weak lensing. The main extensions concern the accommodation of mild non-linearity in inner iterations, the progressive increase in resolution in outer iterations, and the introduction of a suitable regularisation term. The linearity of the method is essentially preserved.  Results: We demonstrate the success of the algorithm with both idealised and realistic simulated data, showing that the simulated lensing mass distribution and its density profile are well reproduced. We then apply it to weak and strong lensing data of the cluster MS 2137 and obtain a parameter-free solution which is in good qualitative agreement with earlier parametric studies.},

	Abstract = {We have made mass maps of three strong-lensing clusters, Abell 3827, Abell 2218 and Abell 1689, in order to test for mass-light offsets. The technique used is GRALE, which enables lens reconstruction with minimal assumptions, and specifically with no information about the cluster light being given. In the first two of these clusters, we find local mass peaks in the central regions that are displaced from the nearby galaxies by a few to several kpc. These offsets could be due to line-of-sight structure unrelated to the clusters, but that is very unlikely, given the typical levels of chance line-of-sight coincidences in Lambda cold dark matter simulations - for Abell 3827 and Abell 2218 the offsets appear to be intrinsic. In the case of Abell 1689, we see no significant offsets in the central region, but we do detect a possible line-of-sight structure: it appears only when sources at z ≳ 3 are used for reconstructing the mass. We discuss possible origins of the mass-galaxy offsets in Abell 3827 and Abell 2218: these include pure gravitational effects like dynamical friction, but also non-standard mechanisms like self-interacting dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We present a non-parametric technique to infer the projected mass distribution of a gravitational lens system with multiple strong-lensed images. The technique involves a dynamic grid in the lens plane on which the mass distribution of the lens is approximated by a sum of basis functions, one per grid cell. We used the projected mass densities of Plummer spheres as basis functions. A genetic algorithm then determines the mass distribution of the lens by forcing images of a single source, projected back on to the source plane, to coincide as well as possible. Averaging several tens of solutions removes the random fluctuations that are introduced by the reproduction process of genomes in the genetic algorithm and highlights those features common to all solutions. Given the positions of the images and the redshifts of the sources and the lens, we show that the mass of a gravitational lens can be retrieved with an accuracy of a few percent and that, if the sources sufficiently cover the caustics, the mass distribution of the gravitational lens can also be reliably retrieved. A major advantage of the algorithm is that it makes full use of the information contained in the radial images, unlike methods that minimize the residuals of the lens equation, and is thus able to accurately reconstruct also the inner parts of the lens.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is considered to be one of the  most powerful tools to study the mass and the mass distribution of  galaxy clusters. However, the mass-sheet degeneracy transformation  has limited its success. We present a novel method for a cluster  mass reconstruction which combines weak and strong lensing  information on common scales and can, as a consequence, break the  mass-sheet degeneracy. We extend the weak lensing formalism to the  inner parts of the cluster and combine it with the constraints from  multiple image systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method  with simulations, finding an excellent agreement between the input  and reconstructed mass also on scales within and beyond the Einstein  radius. Using a single multiple image system and photometric  redshift information of the background sources used for weak and  strong lensing analysis, we find that we are effectively able to  break the mass-sheet degeneracy, therefore removing one of the  main limitations on cluster mass estimates. We conclude that with  high resolution (e.g. HST) imaging data the method can more  accurately reconstruct cluster masses and their profiles than  currently existing lensing techniques.},

	Abstract = {The gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies acts as a cosmic telescope allowing us to find and study galaxies at fainter limits than otherwise possible and thus probe closer to the epoch of formation of the first galaxies. We use the Bullet cluster 1E0657 - 56 (z = 0.296) as a case study, because its high mass and merging configuration makes it one of the most efficient cosmic telescopes we know. We develop a new algorithm to reconstruct the gravitational potential of the Bullet cluster based on a non-uniform adaptive grid, combining strong and weak gravitational lensing data derived from deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys F606W-F775W-F850LP and ground-based imaging. We exploit this improved mass map to study z ~ 5-6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which we detect as dropouts. One of the LBGs is multiply imaged, providing a geometric confirmation of its high redshift, and is used to further improve our mass model. We quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction in the intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that they are negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies. With shallower and comparable magnitude limits to Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), the Bullet cluster observations, after correcting for magnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high-redshift galaxies than GOODS and only slightly shallower than HUDF. We conclude that accurately focused cosmic telescopes are the most efficient way to sample the bright end of the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies and---in case they are multiply imaged---confirm their redshifts.

	Abstract = {We report the first weak lensing detection of a large-scale filament funnelling matter on to the core of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745.  Our analysis is based on a mosaic of 18 multipassband images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, covering an area of ˜10 × 20 arcmin2. We use a weak lensing pipeline developed for the Cosmic Evolution Survey, modified for the analysis of galaxy clusters, to produce a weak lensing catalogue. A mass map is then computed by applying a weak gravitational lensing multiscale reconstruction technique designed to describe irregular mass distributions such as the one investigated here. We test the resulting mass map by comparing the mass distribution inferred for the cluster core with the one derived from strong lensing constraints and find excellent agreement.  Our analysis detects the MACS J0717.5+3745 filament within the 3sigma detection contour of the lensing mass reconstruction, and underlines the importance of filaments for theoretical and numerical models of the mass distribution in the cosmic web. We measure the filament's projected length as ˜4.5 h74-1 Mpc, and its mean density as (2.92 $\pm$ 0.66) × 108 h74 M&sun; kpc-2. Combined with the redshift distribution of galaxies obtained after an extensive spectroscopic follow-up in the area, we can rule out any projection effect resulting from the chance alignment on the sky of unrelated galaxy group-scale structures. Assuming plausible constraints concerning the structure's geometry based on its galaxy velocity field, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) model of the large-scale filament. Within this framework, we derive the 3D length of the filament to be 18 h74-1 Mpc. The filament's deprojected density in terms of the critical density of the Universe is measured as (206 $\pm$ 46) rhocrit, a value that lies at the very high end of the range predicted by numerical simulations. Finally, we study the distribution of stellar mass in the field of MACS J0717.5+3749 and, adopting a mean mass-to-light ratio <M*/LK> of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.22 and assuming a Chabrier initial mass function, measure a stellar mass fraction along the filament of (0.9 $\pm$ 0.2) per cent, consistent with previous measurements in the vicinity of massive clusters.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel technique to refine the modelling of galaxy cluster mass distribution using gravitational lensing. The idea is to combine the strengths of both `parametric' and `non-parametric' methods to improve the quality of the fit. We develop a multiscale model that allows sharper contrast in regions of higher density where the number of constraints is generally higher. Our model consists of (i) a multiscale grid of radial basis functions with physically motivated profiles and (ii) a list of galaxy-scale potentials at the location of the cluster member galaxies. This arrangement of potentials of different sizes allows us to reach a high resolution for the model with a minimum number of parameters. We apply our model to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689. We estimate the quality of our mass reconstruction with a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler. For a selected subset of multiple images, we manage to halve the errors between the positions of predicted and observed images compared to previous studies. This is due to the flexibility of multiscale models at intermediate scale between cluster and galaxy scale. The software developed for this paper is part of the public LENSTOOL package which can be found at http://www.oamp.fr/cosmology/lenstool.},

	Abstract = {Extending over three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) cycles, the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) initiative constitutes the largest commitment ever of HST time to the exploration of the distant Universe via gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters. Here, we present models of the mass distribution in the six HFF cluster lenses, derived from a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis anchored by a total of 88 multiple-image systems identified in existing HST data. The resulting maps of the projected mass distribution and of the gravitational magnification effectively calibrate the HFF clusters as gravitational telescopes. Allowing the computation of search areas in the source plane, these maps are provided to the community to facilitate the exploitation of forthcoming HFF data for quantitative studies of the gravitationally lensed population of background galaxies. Our models of the gravitational magnification afforded by the HFF clusters allow us to quantify the lensing-induced boost in sensitivity over blank-field observations and predict that galaxies at z > 10 and as faint as m(AB) = 32 will be detectable, up to 2 mag fainter than the limit of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.},

@article{Johnson:2014,
	Abstract = {We present strong-lensing models as well as mass and magnification maps for the cores of the six Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Fields galaxy clusters. Our parametric lens models are constrained by the locations and redshifts of multiple image systems of lensed background galaxies. We use a combination of photometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts of the lensed background sources obtained by us (for A2744 and AS1063), collected from the literature, or kindly provided by the lensing community. Using our results, we (1) compare the derived mass distribution of each cluster to its light distribution, (2) quantify the cumulative magnification power of the HST Frontier Fields clusters, (3) describe how our models can be used to estimate the magnification and image multiplicity of lensed background sources at all redshifts and at any position within the cluster cores, and (4) discuss systematic effects and caveats resulting from our modeling methods. We specifically investigate the effect of the use of spectroscopic and photometric redshift constraints on the uncertainties of the resulting models. We find that the photometric redshift estimates of lensed galaxies are generally in excellent agreement with spectroscopic redshifts, where available. However, the flexibility associated with relaxed redshift priors may cause the complexity of large-scale structure that is needed to account for the lensing signal to be underestimated. Our findings thus underline the importance of spectroscopic arc redshifts, or tight photometric redshift constraints, for high precision lens models. All products from our best-fit lens models (magnification, convergence, shear, deflection field) and model simulations for estimating errors are made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.  Based on observations made with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

@article{Jullo:2007,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a procedure for modelling strong lensing galaxy clusters with parametric methods, and to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We use a publicly available Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampler ('bayesys'), allowing us to avoid local minima in the likelihood functions. To illustrate the power of the MCMC technique, we simulate three clusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale halo and a set of perturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three light beams through each model to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler to recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations. We find that, for typical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data, the total mass in the Einstein radius is recovered with ~1 5% error according to the considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the galaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple images appear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is generally recovered with a 20% error, largely due to the poorly constrained cut-off radius. Finally, we describe how to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We confirm the ability of strong lensing to constrain the mass profile in the central region of galaxy clusters in this way. Ultimately, such a method applied to strong lensing clusters with a very large number of multiple images may provide unique geometrical constraints on cosmology. The implementation of the MCMC sampler used in this paper has been done within the framework of the lenstool software package, which is publicly availablewww.oamp.fr/cosmology/lenstool..},

	Abstract = {We present comprehensive analyses of faint dropout galaxies up to z ~ 10 with the first full-depth data set of the A2744 lensing cluster and parallel fields observed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. We identify 54 dropouts at z ~ 5-10 in the HFF fields and enlarge the size of the z ~ 9 galaxy sample obtained to date. Although the number of highly magnified (mu ~ 10) galaxies is small because of the tiny survey volume of strong lensing, our study reaches the galaxies' intrinsic luminosities comparable to the deepest-field HUDF studies. We derive UV luminosity functions with these faint dropouts, carefully evaluating by intensive simulations the combination of observational incompleteness and lensing effects in the image plane, including magnification, distortion, and multiplication of images, with the evaluation of mass model dependencies. Our results confirm that the faint-end slope, alpha, is as steep as -2 at z ~ 6-8 and strengthen the evidence for the rapid decrease of UV luminosity densities, rhoUV, at z > 8 from the large z ~ 9 sample. We examine whether the rapid rhoUV decrease trend can be reconciled with the large Thomson scattering optical depth, taue, measured by cosmic microwave background experiments, allowing a large space of free parameters, such as an average ionizing photon escape fraction and a stellar-population-dependent conversion factor. No parameter set can reproduce both the rapid rhoUV decrease and the large tau e . It is possible that the rhoUV decrease moderates at z >~ 11, that the free parameters significantly evolve toward high z, or that there exist additional sources of reionization such as X-ray binaries and faint active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lens analysis of SDSS J1004+4112, a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.68, using newly developed software for gravitational lensing. We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of mu ˜ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	Abstract = {Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging of the most powerful lensing clusters provides access to the most magnified distant galaxies. The challenge is to construct lens models capable of describing these complex massive, merging clusters so that individual lensed systems can be reliably identified and their intrinsic properties accurately derived. We apply the free-form lensing method (WSLAP+) to A2744, providing a model independent map of the cluster mass, magnification, and geometric distance estimates to multiply lensed sources. We solve simultaneously for a smooth cluster component on a pixel grid, together with local deflections by the cluster member galaxies. Combining model prediction with photometric redshift measurements, we correct and complete several systems recently claimed and identify four new systems totaling 65 images of 21 systems spanning a redshift range of 1.4 < z < 9.8. The reconstructed mass shows small enhancements in the directions where significant amounts of hot plasma can be seen in X-ray. We compare photometric redshifts with "geometric redshifts," finding a high level of self-consistency. We find excellent agreement between predicted and observed fluxes with a best-fit slope of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.013 and an rms of ~0.25 mag, demonstrating that our magnification correction of the lensed background galaxies is very reliable. Intriguingly, few multiply lensed galaxies are detected beyond z ~= 7.0, despite the high magnification and the limiting redshift of z ~= 11.5 permitted by the HFF filters. With the additional HFF clusters, we can better examine the plausibility of any pronounced high-z deficit with potentially important implications for the reionization epoch and the nature of dark matter.},

@article{Foley:2015,
	Abstract = {Calcium-rich supernovae (Ca-rich SNe) are peculiar low-luminosity SNe Ib with relatively strong Ca spectral lines at ~2 months after peak brightness. This class also has an extended projected offset distribution, with several members of the class offset from their host galaxies by 30 - 150 kpc. There is no indication of any stellar population at the SN positions. Using a sample of 13 Ca-rich SNe, we present kinematic evidence that the progenitors of Ca-rich SNe originate near the centers of their host galaxies and are kicked to the locations of the SN explosions. Specifically, SNe with small projected offsets have large line-of-sight velocity shifts as determined by nebular lines, while those with large projected offsets have no significant velocity shifts. Therefore, the velocity shifts must not be primarily the result of the SN explosion. There is an excess of SNe with blueshifted velocity shifts within two isophotal radii (5/6 SNe), indicating that the SNe are moving away from their host galaxies and redshifted SNe on the far sides of their galaxies are selectively missed in SN surveys. Additionally, nearly every Ca-rich SN is hosted by a galaxy with indications of a recent merger and/or is in a dense environment. We propose a progenitor model which fits all current data: The progenitor system for a Ca-rich SN is a double white dwarf (WD) system where at least one WD has a significant He abundance. This system, through an interaction with a super-massive black hole (SMBH) is ejected from its host galaxy and the binary is hardened, significantly reducing the merger time. After 10 - 100 Myr (on average), the system explodes with a large physical offset. The rate for such events is significantly enhanced for galaxies which have undergone recent mergers, potentially making Ca-rich SNe new probes of both the galaxy merger rate and (binary) SMBH population.

	Abstract = {We analyze the clump population of the spiral galaxy Sp 1149 at redshift 1.5. Located behind the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, Sp 1149 has been significantly magnified allowing us to study the galaxy on physical scales down to ~100 pc. The galaxy cluster frame is among the targets of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH), an ongoing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multi-Cycle Treasury program. We have used the publicly available multi-band imaging data set to reconstruct the spectral energy distributions of the clumps in Sp 1149, and derive, by means of stellar evolutionary models, their physical properties. We found that 40% of the clumps observed in Sp 1149 are older than 30 Myr and can be as old as 300 Myr. These are also the more massive (luminous) clumps in the galaxy. Among the complexes in the local reference sample, the star-forming knots in luminous blue compact galaxies could be considered progenitor analogs of these long-lived clumps. The remaining 60% of clumps have colors comparable to local cluster complexes, suggesting a similar young age. We observe that the Sp 1149 clumps follow the MvpropR 2 relation similar to local cluster complexes, suggesting similar formation mechanisms although they may have different initial conditions (e.g., higher gas surface densities). We suggest that the galaxy is experiencing a slow decline in star formation rate and a likely transitional phase toward a more quiescent star formation mode. The older clumps have survived between 6 and 20 dynamical times and are all located at projected distances smaller than 4 kpc from the center. Their current location suggests migration toward the center and the possibility of being the building blocks of the bulge. On the other hand, the dynamical timescale of the younger clumps is significantly shorter, meaning that they are quite close to their birthplace. We show that the clumps of Sp 1149 may account for the expected metal-rich globular cluster population usually associated with the bulge and thick disk components of local spirals.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program 12065.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the B- and V-band rise-time distributions of nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Drawing mostly from the recently published Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample of SNe Ia, together with other published nearby SNe Ia with data starting at least 1 week before maximum light, we use a two-stretch template-fitting method to measure the rise and decline of BV light curves. Our analysis of 61 SNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between explosion and maximum light (i.e. the rise time), the slower the decline of the light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline rates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family of light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter family of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for spectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity (HV) spectral features indicates that HV SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise times compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After normalizing the B-band light curves to Deltam15(B) = 1.1 mag (i.e. correcting the post-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that spectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 $\pm$ 0.24 d, while HV SNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 $\pm$ 0.29 d. Despite differences in the B band, we find that HV and normal SNe Ia have similar rise times in the V band. Furthermore, the initial rise of a SN Ia B-band light curve follows a power law with index 2.20+0.27- 0.19, consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted by an expanding fireball toy model. We compare our early-time B-band data to models for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from the single-degenerate progenitor scenario. There is a substantial degree of degeneracy between the adopted power-law index of the SN light-curve template, the rise time and the amount of shock emission required to match the data.},

	Abstract = {The merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) ejects a small quantity of neutron-rich matter, the radioactive decay of which powers a day to week long thermal transient known as a kilonova. Most of the ejecta remains sufficiently dense during its expansion that all neutrons are captured into nuclei during the r-process. However, recent general relativistic merger simulations by Bauswein and collaborators show that a small fraction of the ejected mass (a few per cent, or ˜10-4 M&sun;) expands sufficiently rapidly for most neutrons to avoid capture. This matter originates from the shocked-heated interface between the merging NSs. Here, we show that the beta-decay of these free neutrons in the outermost ejecta powers a `precursor' to the main kilonova emission, which peaks on a time-scale of ˜ few hours following merger at U-band magnitude ˜22 (for an assumed distance of 200 Mpc). The high luminosity and blue colours of the neutron precursor render it a potentially important counterpart to the gravitational wave source, that may encode valuable information on the properties of the merging binary (e.g. NS-NS versus NS-black hole) and the NS equation of state. Future work is necessary to assess the robustness of the fast-moving ejecta and the survival of free neutrons in the face of neutrino absorptions, although the precursor properties are robust to a moderate amount of leptonization. Our results provide additional motivation for short latency gravitational wave triggers and rapid follow-up searches with sensitive ground-based telescopes.},

@article{Kasen:2014,
	Abstract = {We study the radioactively-powered transients produced by accretion disk winds following a compact object merger. Starting with the outflows generated in two-dimensional hydrodynamical disk models, we use wavelength-dependent radiative transfer calculations to generate synthetic light curves and spectra. We show that the brightness and color of the resulting kilonova transients carry information about the merger physics. In the regions of the wind where neutrino irradiation raises the electron fraction to Ye > 0.25, r-process nucleosynthesis halts before producing high-opacity, complex ions (the lanthanides). The kilonova light curves thus show two distinct components: a brief (~2 day) blue optical transient produced in the outer lanthanide-free ejecta, and a longer (~10 day) infrared transient produced in the inner, lanthanide line-blanketed region. Mergers producing a longer-lived neutron star, or a more rapidly spinning black hole, have stronger neutrino irradiation, generate more lanthanide-free ejecta, and are optically brighter and bluer. At least some optical emission is produced in all disk wind models, which should enhance the detectability of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources. However, the presence of even a small amount (10^{-4} Msun) of overlying, neutron-rich dynamical ejecta will act as a "lanthanide-curtain", obscuring the optical wind emission from certain viewing angles. Because the disk outflows have moderate velocities (~10,000 km/s), numerous resolved line features are discernible in the spectra, distinguishing disk winds from fast-moving dynamical ejecta, and offering a potential diagnostic of the detailed composition of freshly produced r-process material.},

	Abstract = {We present 645 optical spectra of 73 supernovae (SNe) of Types IIb, Ib, Ic, and broad-lined Ic. All of these types are attributed to the core collapse of massive stars, with varying degrees of intact H and He envelopes before explosion. The SNe in our sample have a mean redshift langczrang = 4200 km s-1. Most of these spectra were gathered at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) between 2004 and 2009. For 53 SNe, these are the first published spectra. The data coverage ranges from mere identification (1-3 spectra) for a few SNe to extensive series of observations (10-30 spectra) that trace the spectral evolution for others, with an average of 9 spectra per SN. For 44 SNe of the 73 SNe presented here, we have well-determined dates of maximum light to determine the phase of each spectrum. Our sample constitutes the most extensive spectral library of stripped-envelope SNe to date. We provide very early coverage (as early as 30 days before V-band max) for photospheric spectra, as well as late-time nebular coverage when the innermost regions of the SN are visible (as late as 2 yr after explosion, while for SN 1993J, we have data as late as 11.6 yr). This data set has homogeneous observations and reductions that allow us to study the spectroscopic diversity of these classes of stripped SNe and to compare these to SNe-gamma-ray bursts. We undertake these matters in follow-up papers.},

	Abstract = {In this first paper in a series, we present 1298 low-redshift (z ≲ 0.2) optical spectra of 582 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed from 1989 to 2008 as part of the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP). 584 spectra of 199 SNe Ia have well-calibrated light curves with measured distance moduli, and many of the spectra have been corrected for host-galaxy contamination. Most of the data were obtained using the Kast double spectrograph mounted on the Shane 3 m telescope at Lick Observatory and have a typical wavelength range of 3300-10 400 {\AA}, roughly twice as wide as spectra from most previously published data sets. We present our observing and reduction procedures, and we describe the resulting SN Database, which will be an online, public, searchable data base containing all of our fully reduced spectra and companion photometry. In addition, we discuss our spectral classification scheme (using the SuperNova IDentification code, SNID; Blondin & Tonry), utilizing our newly constructed set of SNID spectral templates. These templates allow us to accurately classify our entire data set, and by doing so we are able to reclassify a handful of objects as bona fide SNe Ia and a few other objects as members of some of the peculiar SN Ia subtypes. In fact, our data set includes spectra of nearly 90 spectroscopically peculiar SNe Ia. We also present spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts of some SNe Ia where these values were previously unknown. The sheer size of the BSNIP data set and the consistency of our observation and reduction methods make this sample unique among all other published SN Ia data sets and complementary in many ways to the large, low-redshift SN Ia spectra presented by Matheson et al. and Blondin et al. In other BSNIP papers in this series, we use these data to examine the relationships between spectroscopic characteristics and various observables such as photometric and host-galaxy properties.},

	Abstract = {The tasks of the DAOPHOT program, developed to exploit the capability of photometrically linear image detectors to perform stellar photometry in crowded fields, are discussed. Raw CCD images are prepared prior to analysis, and following the obtaining of an initial star list with the FIND program, synthetic aperture photometry is performed on the detected objects with the PHOT routine. A local sky brightness and a magnitude are computed for each star in each of the specified stellar apertures, and for crowded fields, the empirical point-spread function must then be obtained for each data frame. The GROUP routine divides the star list for a given frame into optimum subgroups, and then the NSTAR routine is used to obtain photometry for all the stars in the frame by means of least- squares profile fits. The process is illustrated with images of stars in a crowded field, and shortcomings and possible improvements of the program are considered.},

@article{Sanders:2014,
	Abstract = {In recent years, the advent of wide-field sky surveys which obtain deep multi-band imaging has presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitor populations of core-collapse supernovae (SN): systematic light curve studies. We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using both spectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and apply a new Bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each light curve in the sample. We find no evidence for the existence of a discontinuous sub-population of fast-declining explosions (historically referred to as "Type IIL" SNe). However, we identify a highly significant continuous relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single predominant explosion parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, controlling the most significant observational outcomes of red supergiant explosions. We compare each light curve to physical models from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and other properties of the PS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of certain systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light curve properties, and an expanded grid of progenitor mass and explosion energy ranges, are needed to enable robust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind. This work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapse SNe to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.},

	Abstract = {The association of long gamma-ray bursts with supernovae naturally suggests that the cosmic GRB rate should trace the star formation history. Finding otherwise would provide important clues concerning these rare, curious phenomena. Using a new estimate of Swift GRB energetics to construct a sample of 36 luminous GRBs with redshifts in the range z = 0-4, we find evidence of enhanced evolution in the GRB rate, with ~4 times as many GRBs observed at z~4 than expected from star formation measurements. This direct and empirical demonstration of needed additional evolution is a new result. It is consistent with theoretical expectations from metallicity effects, but other causes remain possible, and we consider them systematically.},

@article{Ishida:2011,
	Abstract = {We propose a novel approach, based on principal components analysis, to the use of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as probes of cosmic star formation history (SFH) up to very high redshifts. The main advantage of such approach is to avoid the necessity of assuming an ad hoc parametrization of the SFH. We first validate the method by reconstructing a known SFH from Monte Carlo generated mock data. We then apply the method to the most recent Swift data of GRBs with known redshift and compare it against the SFH obtained by independent methods. The main conclusion is that the level of star formation activity at z≈ 9.4 could have been already as high as the present-day one (≈0.01 M&sun; yr-1 Mpc-3). This is a factor 3-5 times higher than deduced from high-z galaxy searches through drop-out techniques. If true, this might alleviate the longstanding problem of a photon-starving reionization; it might also indicate that galaxies accounting for most of the star formation activity at high redshift go undetected by even the most deep searches.},

@article{Campisi:2011,
	Abstract = {Because massive, low-metallicity Population III (PopIII) stars may produce very powerful long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), high-redshift GRB observations could probe the properties of the first stars. We analyse the correlation between early PopIII stars and LGRBs by using cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, which include detailed chemical evolution, cooling, star formation, feedback effects and the transition between PopIII and more standard Population I/II (PopII/I) stars. From the Swift observed rate of LGRBs, we estimate the fraction of black holes that will produce a GRB from PopII/I stars to be in the range 0.028 < fGRB < 0.140, depending on the assumed upper metallicity of the progenitor. Assuming that as of today no GRB event has been associated with a PopIII star, we estimate the upper limit for the fraction of LGRBs produced by PopIII stars to be in the range 0.006 < fGRB < 0.022. When we apply a detection threshold compatible with the BAT instrument, we find that the expected fraction of PopIII GRBs (GRB3) is ˜10 per cent of the full LGRB population at z > 6, becoming as high as 40 per cent at z > 10. Finally, we study the properties of the galaxies hosting our sample of GRB3s. We find that the average metallicity of the galaxies hosting a GRB3 is typically higher than the critical metallicity used to select the PopIII stars, due to the efficiency in polluting the gas above such low values. We also find that the highest probability of finding a GRB3 occurs within galaxies with a stellar mass <107 M&sun;, independent of the redshift.},

	Abstract = {We present deep 3.6 cm radio continuum observations of the H II region W40 obtained using the Very Large Array (VLA) in its A and B configurations. We detect a total of 20 compact radio sources in a region of 4' × 4', with 11 of them concentrated in a band with 30'' of extent. We also present JHK photometry of the W40 cluster taken with the QUIRC instrument on the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope. These data reveal that 15 of the 20 VLA sources have infrared counterparts, and 10 show radio variability with periods less than 20 days. Based on these combined radio and IR data, we propose that eight of the radio sources are candidate ultracompact H II regions, seven are likely to be young stellar objects, and two may be shocked interstellar gas.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of 24 Lyman-break candidates at 7 <~ z <~ 10.5, in the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data of A2744 (z = 0.308), plus Spitzer/IRAC data and archival ACS data. The sample includes a triple image system with a photometric redshift of z ~= 7.4. This high redshift is geometrically confirmed by our lens model corresponding to deflection angles that are 12% larger than the lower-redshift systems used to calibrate the lens model at z = 2.019. The majority of our high-redshift candidates are not expected to be multiply lensed given their locations in the image plane and the brightness of foreground galaxies, but are magnified by factors of ~1.3-15, so that we are seeing further down the luminosity function than comparable deep-field imaging. It is apparent that the redshift distribution of these sources does not smoothly extend over the full redshift range accessible at z < 12, but appears to break above z = 9. Nine candidates are clustered within a small region of 20'' across, representing a potentially unprecedented concentration. Given the poor statistics, however, we must await similar constraints from the additional HFF clusters to properly examine this trend. The physical properties of our candidates are examined using the range of lens models developed for the HFF program by various groups including our own, for a better estimate of underlying systematics. Our spectral-energy-distribution fits for the brightest objects suggest stellar masses of ~= 109 M &sun;, star formation rates of ~= 4 M &sun; yr--1, and a typical formation redshift of z <~ 19.},

	Abstract = {We present a new photometric identification technique for SN 1991bg-like type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e., objects with light curve characteristics such as later primary maxima and the absence of a secondary peak in redder filters. This method is capable of selecting this sub-group from the normal type Ia population. Furthermore, we find that recently identified peculiar sub-types such as SNe Iax and super-Chandrasekhar SNe Ia have photometric characteristics similar to 91bg-like SNe Ia, namely, the absence of secondary maxima and shoulders at longer wavelengths, and can also be classified with our technique. The similarity of these different SN Ia sub-groups perhaps suggests common physical conditions. This typing methodology permits the photometric identification of peculiar SNe Ia in large upcoming wide-field surveys either to study them further or to obtain a pure sample of normal SNe Ia for cosmological studies.},

	Abstract = {We perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-line galaxies at kiloparsec scales to investigate how small-scale and global properties of galaxies are related. We use a sample of 119 galaxies in the GOODS fields. The galaxies are selected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.3. High resolution spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS observations are used to fix the redshift of all the galaxies in our sample. Using the HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 imaging data taken as a part of the CANDELS project, for each galaxy, we perform spectral energy distribution fitting per resolution element, producing resolved rest-frame U -- V color, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), age, and extinction maps. We develop a technique to identify "regions" of statistical significance within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps to select red and blue regions, a broader definition for what are called "clumps" in other works. As expected, for any given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surface densities and older ages compared to the blue regions. Furthermore, we quantify the spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshift and stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions toward the centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift or stellar mass. We find that the "main sequence" of star-forming galaxies exists among both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blue regions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.1 and a scatter of ~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1 and a scatter of ~0.6 dex. The blue regions show higher specific SFRs (sSFRs) than their red counterparts with the sSFR decreasing since z ~ 1, driven primarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the SFRs at a given resolution element.},

@article{Vinko:2015,
	Abstract = {We present follow-up observations of an optical transient (OT) discovered by ROTSE on 2009 January 21. Photometric monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb in the optical and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The light curve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the next 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni---56Co radioactive decay. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 database contains a faint, red object at the position of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of evidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object is likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope between +8 and +45 days after discovery revealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak features that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying host. Fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy revealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift, the peak magnitude of the OT is close to --22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however, the lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death hypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal disruption of a Sun-like star by the central supermassive black hole. We argue that this transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington tidal disruption events.},

	Abstract = {The flux from distant Type Ia supernovae (SNe) is likely to be amplified or de-amplified by gravitational lensing due to matter distributions along the line of sight. A gravitationally lensed supernova would appear brighter or fainter than the average SN at a particular redshift. We estimate the magnification of 26 SNe in the GOODS fields and search for a correlation with the residual magnitudes of the SNe. The residual magnitude, i.e. the difference between observed and average magnitude predicted by the 'concordance model' of the Universe, indicates the deviation in flux from the average SN. The linear correlation coefficient for this sample is r = 0.29. For a similar, but uncorrelated sample, the probability of obtaining a correlation coefficient equal to or higher than this value is ~10%, i.e. a tentative detection of lensing at ~90% confidence level. Although the evidence for a correlation is weak, our result is in accordance with what could be expected given the small size of the sample.},

	Abstract = {Aims: To investigate the effect of gravitational lensing of supernovae in large ongoing surveys.  Methods: We simulate the effect of gravitational lensing magnification on individual supernovae using observational data input from two large supernova surveys. To estimate the magnification due to matter in the foreground, we simulate galaxy catalogs and compute the magnification along individual lines of sight using the multiple lens plane algorithm. The dark matter haloes of the galaxies are modelled as gravitational lenses using singular isothermal sphere or Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. Scaling laws between luminosity and mass, provided by Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, are used to estimate the masses of the haloes.   Results: While our simulations show that the SDSSII supernova survey is marginally affected by gravitational lensing, we find that the effect will be measurable in the SNLS survey that probes higher redshifts. Our simulations show that the probability to measure a significant (3sigma) correlation between the Hubble diagram residuals and the calculated lensing magnification is ⪆95% in the SNLS data. Moreover, with this data it should be possible to constrain the normalisation of the masses of the lensing galaxy haloes at the 1sigma and 2sigma confidence level with ˜ 30% and ~ 60% accuracy, respectively.},

@article{Holz:1998a,
	Abstract = {We present a new approach to calculating the statistical distributions for magnification, shear, and rotation of images of cosmological sources due to gravitational lensing. In this approach one specifies an underlying Robertson-Walker cosmological model together with relevant information on the clumping of matter on scales much smaller than the Hubble radius. The geodesic deviation equation is then integrated backwards in time until the desired redshift is reached, using a Monte Carlo procedure wherein each photon beam in effect ``creates its own universe'' as it propagates. The approach is somewhat similar to that used in ``Swiss cheese'' models, but the ``cheese'' has been completely eliminated, the matter distribution in the ``voids'' need not be spherically symmetric, the total mass in each void need equal the corresponding Robertson-Walker mass only on average, and we do not impose an ``opaque radius'' cutoff. The case where the matter in the universe consists of point masses is studied in detail, and it is shown that the statistical distributions of the lensing images are essentially independent of both the mass spectrum and the clustering properties of the point masses, provided that the clustering is spherical. Detailed results for the distribution of the magnification of images are presented for the point mass case, as well as a number of other matter distributions. We apply our results (i) to argue that the positive correlation recently found between quasar luminosity and the number of absorption line systems is not likely to be due to lensing, and (ii) to determine the amount of ``noise'' and possible bias produced by lensing in measurements of q0 using distant supernovas.},

@article{Jonsson:2010a,
	Abstract = {High-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely to be gravitationally lensed by dark matter haloes of galaxies in the foreground. Since SNe Ia have very small dispersion after light-curve shape and colour corrections, their brightness can be used to measure properties of the dark matter haloes via gravitational magnification. We use observations of galaxies and SNe Ia within the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) to measure the relation between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass. The relation we investigate is a scaling law between velocity dispersion and galaxy luminosity in the B band: sigma = sigma*(L/L*)eta, where L* = 1010h-2Lsolar. The best-fitting values to this relation are sigma* = 136 kms-1 and eta = 0.27. We find sigma* <~ 190 kms-1 at the 95 per cent confidence level. This method provides an independent cross-check of measurements of dark matter halo properties from galaxy-galaxy lensing studies. Our results agree with the galaxy-galaxy lensing results, but have much larger uncertainties. The GOODS sample of SNe Ia is relatively small (we include 24 SNe) and the results therefore depend on individual SNe Ia. We have investigated a number of potential systematic effects. Light-curve fitting, which affects the inferred brightness of the SNe Ia, appears to be the most important one. Results obtained using different light-curve fitting procedures differ at the 68.3 per cent confidence level.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the possibility of correcting for magnification due to gravitational lensing of standard candle sources, such as Type Ia supernovae. Our method uses the observed properties of the foreground galaxies along the lines of sight to each source, and the accuracy of the lensing correction depends on the quality and depth of these observations as well as the uncertainties in translating the observed luminosities to the matter distribution in the lensing galaxies. The current work is limited to cases in which the matter density is dominated by the individual galaxy halos. However, it is straightforward to generalize the method to also include gravitational lensing from cluster scale halos. We show that the dispersion due to lensing for a standard candle source at z=1.5 can be reduced from about 7% to <~3% i.e., the magnification correction is useful in reducing the scatter in the Type Ia Hubble diagram, especially at high redshifts where the required long exposure times make it hard to reach large statistics and the dispersion due to lensing becomes comparable to the intrinsic Type Ia scatter.},

The tests were designed so that the simulations resemble as much as possible deep digitized data from a 4 m type telescope prime focus plate. Nevertheless, the following results are applicable to data from CCD frames or other size telescopes, provided an appropriate scaling is done. (1) The detection was found to be 95% complete up to J = 23.7 mag for galaxies at a mean redshift z = 0.5. (2) The r-2 star/galaxy classifier proved to be reliable up to J ≈ 22 and (3) the photometry as done with the "first moment" method yields uncertainties of the order of $\pm$0.17 mag at J = 23.0 mag.},

	Abstract = {Given the growing use of S{\'e}rsic's (1963, 1968) R1/n model for describing the stellar distributions in galaxies, and the lack of any single reference that provides the various associated mathematical expressions, we have endeavoured to compile such a resource here. We present the standard intensity profile, and its various guises such as the luminosity, surface-brightness, and aperture-magnitude profile. Expressions to transform the effective surface brightness into the mean effective and central surface brightness are also given, as is the expression to transform between effective radii and exponential scale-lengths. We additionally provide expressions for deriving the `concentration' of an R1/n profile, and two useful equations for the logarithmic slope of the light-profile are given. Petrosian radii and fluxes are also derived for a range of S{\'e}rsic profiles and compared with the effective radii and total flux. Similarly, expressions to obtain Kron radii and fluxes are presented as a function of the S{\'e}rsic index n and the number of effective radii sampled. Illustrative figures are provided throughout. Finally, the core-S{\'e}rsic model, consisting of an inner power-law and an outer S{\'e}rsic function, is presented.},

	Abstract = {Context. Photometric redshifts (photo-z's) have become an essential tool in extragalactic astronomy. Many current and upcoming observing programmes require great accuracy of photo-z's to reach their scientific goals.  Aims: Here we introduce PHAT, the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing programme, an international initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-z estimation.  Methods: Two different test environments are set up, one (PHAT0) based on simulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, and another one (PHAT1) based on data from the GOODS survey including 18-band photometry and ~2000 spectroscopic redshifts.  Results: The accuracy of the different methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter, and outlier rates. While most methods agree very well on PHAT0 there are differences in the handling of the Lyman-alpha forest for higher redshifts. Furthermore, different methods produce photo-z scatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case. A larger spread in accuracy is found for PHAT1. Few methods benefit from the addition of mid-IR photometry. The accuracy of the other methods is unaffected or suffers when IRAC data are included. Remaining biases and systematic effects can be explained by shortcomings in the different template sets (especially in the mid-IR) and the use of priors on the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. Some strategies to overcome these problems are identified by comparing the methods in detail. Scatters of 4-8% in Deltaz/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. However, somewhat larger outlier rates (>7.5% with Deltaz/(1+z)>0.15; >4.5% after cleaning) are found for all codes that can only partly be explained by AGN or issues in the photometry or the spec-z catalogue. Some outliers were probably missed in comparisons of photo-z's to other, less complete spectroscopic surveys in the past. There is a general trend that empirical codes produce smaller biases than template-based codes.  Conclusions: The systematic, quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard for the assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. The rather large outlier rates reported here for PHAT1 on real data should be investigated further since they are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many other studies. The test data sets are publicly available and can be used to compare new, upcoming methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z method development.  Based on observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Keck Observatory, the Kitt Peak National Observatory, the Subaru Telescope, the Palomar Observatory, and the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope.},

	Abstract = {We present VLT FORS1 and FORS2 spectra of 39 candidate high-redshift supernovae that were discovered as part of a cosmological study using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) over a wide range of redshifts. From the spectra alone, 20 candidates are spectrally classified as SNe Ia with redshifts ranging from z=0.212 to z=1.181. Of the remaining 19 candidates, 1 might be a type II supernova and 11 exhibit broad supernova-like spectral features and/or have supernova-like light curves. The candidates were discovered in 8 separate ground-based searches. In those searches in which SNe Ia at z ˜ 0.5 were targeted, over 80% of the observed candidates were spectrally classified as SNe Ia. In those searches in which SNe Ia with z > 1 were targeted, 4 candidates with z > 1 were spectrally classified as SNe Ia and later followed with ground and space based observatories. We present the spectra of all candidates, including those that could not be spectrally classified as supernova.  Based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory using the ESO Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal (ESO programs 265.A-5721(A), 67.A-0361(A), 267.A-5688(A), 169.A-0382(A) and (B)).

	Abstract = {We present spectra of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) that were taken with the Subaru low-resolution optical spectrograph, FOCAS. These SNe were found in SN surveys with Suprime-Cam on Subaru, the CFH12k camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. These SN surveys specifically targeted z > 1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). From the spectra of 39 candidates, we obtained redshifts for 32 candidates and spectroscopically identified 7 active candidates as probable SNe Ia, including one at z = 1.35, which is the most distant SN Ia to be spectroscopically confirmed with a ground-based telescope. An additional 4 candidates were identified as likely SNe Ia from the spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. Seven candidates are not SNe Ia, either being SNe of another type or active galactic nuclei. When SNe Ia were observed within one week of the maximum light, we found that we could spectroscopically identify most of them up to z = 1.1. Beyond this redshift, very few candidates were spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia. The current generation of super red-sensitive, fringe-free CCDs will push this redshift limit higher.},

	Abstract = {We derive empirical models for galaxy mass assembly histories, and convolve these with theoretical delay time distribution (DTD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to derive the distribution of progenitor ages for all SNe Ia occurring at a given epoch of cosmic time. In actively star-forming galaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a t-1 SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming galaxies at all epochs of cosmic history. In passive galaxies, which have ceased star formation through some quenching process, the SN Ia age distribution peaks at the quenching epoch, which in passive galaxies evolves in redshift to track the past epoch of major star formation. Our models reproduce the SN Ia rate evolution in redshift, the relationship between SN Ia stretch and host mass, and the distribution of SN Ia host masses in a manner qualitatively consistent with observations. Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to be actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive, consistent with observations of galaxy `downsizing'. Consequently, the mean ages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to old ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN Ia Hubble residuals with host mass. The age discrepancy evolves with redshift in a manner currently not accounted for in SN Ia cosmology analyses. We thus suggest that SNe Ia selected only from actively star-forming galaxies will yield the most cosmologically uniform sample, due to the homogeneity of young SN Ia progenitor ages at all cosmological epochs.},

@article{Astier:2014,
	Abstract = {We forecast dark energy constraints that could be obtained from a new large sample of Type Ia supernovae where those at high redshift are acquired with the Euclid space mission. We simulate a three-prong SN survey: a z < 0.35 nearby sample (8000 SNe), a 0.2 < z < 0.95 intermediate sample (8800 SNe), and a 0.75 < z < 1.55 high-z sample (1700 SNe). The nearby and intermediate surveys are assumed to be conducted from the ground, while the high-z is a joint ground- and space-based survey. This latter survey, the "Dark Energy Supernova Infra-Red Experiment" (DESIRE), is designed to fit within 6 months of Euclid observing time, with a dedicated observing programme. We simulate the SN events as they would be observed in rolling-search mode by the various instruments, and derive the quality of expected cosmological constraints. We account for known systematic uncertainties, in particular calibration uncertainties including their contribution through the training of the supernova model used to fit the supernovae light curves. Using conservative assumptions and a 1D geometric Planck prior, we find that the ensemble of surveys would yield competitive constraints: a constant equation of stateparameter can be constrained to sigma(w) = 0.022, and a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 203 is found for a two-parameter equation of state. Our simulations thus indicate that Euclid can bring a significant contribution to a purely geometrical cosmology constraint by extending a high-quality SN Ia Hubble diagram to z ~ 1.5. We also present other science topics enabled by the DESIRE Euclid observations.},

@article{Dobler:2006,
	Abstract = {Given the number of recently discovered galaxy-galaxy lens systems, we anticipate that a gravitationally lensed supernova will be observed within the next few years. We explore the possibility that stars in the lens galaxy will produce observable microlensing fluctuations in lensed supernova light curves. For typical parameters, we predict that ~70% of lensed SNe will show microlensing fluctuations of >0.5 mag, while ~25% will have fluctuations of >1 mag. Thus, microlensing of lensed supernova will be both ubiquitous and observable. In addition, we show that microlensing fluctuations will complicate measurements of time delays from multiply imaged supernovae: time delays accurate to better than a few days will be difficult to obtain. We also consider prospects for extracting the lens galaxy's stellar mass fraction and mass function from microlensing fluctuations via a new statistical measure, the time-weighted light-curve derivative.},

	Abstract = {Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with a presently large fraction of the energy density stored in an X-component with wX<-1/3, are considered. We find all the critical points of the system for constant equations of state in that range. We consider further several background quantities that can distinguish the models with different wX values. Using a simple toy model with a varying equation of state, we show that even a large variation of wX at small redshifts is very difficult to observe with dL(z) measurements up to z~1. Therefore, it will require accurate measurements in the range 1<z<2 and independent accurate knowledge of Omegam,0 (and/or OmegaX,0) in order to resolve a variable wX from a constant wX.},

	Abstract = {We have updated and extended our semi-analytic galaxy formation modelling capabilities and applied them simultaneously to the stored halo/subhalo merger trees of the Millennium and Millennium-II Simulations (MS and MS-II, respectively). These differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowing explicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. We have revised the treatment of the transition between the rapid infall and cooling flow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges, and of gaseous and stellar discs, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and satellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star stripping, once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of low-redshift galaxies over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9 mag in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way satellites. This suggests that reionization effects may not be needed to solve the 'missing-satellite' problem, except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The same model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to ˜30 kpc for massive galaxies. For M* < 6 × 1010 M&sun;, however, the model overpredicts clustering at scales below ˜1 Mpc, suggesting that the assumed fluctuation amplitude, sigma8= 0.9, is too high. The observed difference in clustering between active and passive galaxies is matched quite well for all masses. Galaxy distributions within rich clusters agree between the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter subhaloes (so-called orphans) are included. Even at MS-II resolution, schemes which assign galaxies only to resolved dark matter subhaloes cannot match observed clusters. Our model predicts a larger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an overabundance of ˜1010 M&sun; galaxies beyond z˜ 0.6. (The abundance of ˜1011 M&sun; galaxies is matched out to z˜ 3.) These discrepancies appear to reflect deficiencies in the way star formation rates are modelled.},

	Abstract = {We describe the TFIT software package to measure galaxy photometry using prior information from high-resolution observations. Our basic methodology is similar in principle but different in detail from previous procedures for crowded field photometry. We use the spatial positions and morphologies of objects in an image with higher angular resolution to construct object templates, which are then fitted to a lower resolution image, solving for the object fluxes as free parameters. Using extensive experiments on both simulated and real data, we show that this template-fitting method measures accurate object photometry to the limiting sensitivity of the image. In this limit, our method derives robust flux upper limits for objects fainter than the limiting image surface brightness. We describe the challenges encountered in applying this technique to real data, and methods to cope with some of them.},

	Abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a wide-field experiment designed to investigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutes to years. PTF uses the CFH12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9deg and a plate scale of 1" pixel, mounted on the Palomar Observatory 48 inch Samuel Oschin Telescope. The PTF operation strategy is devised to probe the existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoretically predicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae, macronovae, .Ia supernovae, and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. PTF will also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmic variables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei, and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics (through RR Lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-Earth objects). The lessons that can be learned from PTF will be essential for the preparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. In this article we present the scientific motivation for PTF and describe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.},

	Abstract = {The intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) detection of the most recent outburst of the recurrent nova (RN) system RX J0045.4+4154 in the Andromeda galaxy has enabled the unprecedented study of a massive (M > 1.3 M &sun;) accreting white dwarf (WD). We detected this nova as part of the near-daily iPTF monitoring of M31 to a depth of R ≈ 21 mag and triggered optical photometry, spectroscopy and soft X-ray monitoring of the outburst. Peaking at an absolute magnitude of MR = -6.6 mag, and with a decay time of 1 mag per day, it is a faint and very fast nova. It shows optical emission lines of He/N and expansion velocities of 1900-2600 km s-1 1-4 days after the optical peak. The Swift monitoring of the X-ray evolution revealed a supersoft source (SSS) with kT eff ≈ 90-110 eV that appeared within 5 days after the optical peak, and lasted only 12 days. Most remarkably, this is not the first event from this system, rather it is an RN with a time between outbursts of approximately 1 yr, the shortest known. Recurrent X-ray emission from this binary was detected by ROSAT in 1992 and 1993, and the source was well characterized as a M > 1.3 M &sun; WD SSS. Based on the observed recurrence time between different outbursts, the duration and effective temperature of the SS phase, MESA models of accreting WDs allow us to constrain the accretion rate to \dot{M} \gt 1.7\times 10^{-7}\ {M_{\odot }\ yr}^{-1} and WD mass >1.30 M &sun;. If the WD keeps 30% of the accreted material, it will take less than a Myr to reach core densities high enough for carbon ignition (if made of C/O) or electron capture (if made of O/Ne) to end the binary evolution.},

	Abstract = {Context. In late Nov. 2013 the fifth eruption in five years of the M 31 recurrent nova M 31N 2008-12a was announced.  Aims: In this Letter we address the optical lightcurve and progenitor system of M 31N 2008-12a.  Methods: Optical imaging data of the 2013 eruption from the Liverpool Telescope, La Palma; Danish 1.54 m Telescope, La Silla; and archival Hubble Space Telescope near-IR, optical, and near-UV data are astrometrically and photometrically analysed.  Results: Photometry of the 2013 eruption, combined with three previous eruptions, enabled construction of a template lightcurve of a very fast nova (t2(V)~=4 days). The archival data allowed recovery of the progenitor system in optical and near-UV data, indicating a red-giant secondary with bright accretion disk, or alternatively a system with a sub-giant secondary but dominated by a disk.  Conclusions: The eruptions of M 31N 2008-12a, and a number of historic X-ray detections, indicate a unique system with a recurrence timescale of ~1 yr. This implies the presence of a very high-mass white dwarf and a high accretion rate. The recovered progenitor system is consistent with such an elevated rate of accretion. We encourage additional observations, especially towards the end of 2014.},

@article{Matheson:2000,
	Abstract = {We present the first unambiguous detection of helium emission lines in spectra of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic). The presence of He I lines with FWHM~2000 km s-1 and the distinct absence of any other intermediate-width emission (e.g., Halpha) implies that the ejecta of SN Ic 1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almost pure helium. This strengthens the argument that the progenitors of SNe Ic are core-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and helium envelopes, either through a dense wind or mass transfer to a companion. In this way, SN 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J that helped firmly establish a physical connection between Type Ib and Type II supernovae. The light curve of SN 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapid rise followed by a quick decline. SN 1999cq is also found to exhibit a high level of emission at blue wavelengths (<~5500 {\AA}), likely resulting from either an unusually large amount of iron and iron-group element emission or uncharacteristically low reddening compared with other SNe Ic.},

@article{Ofek:2010,
	Abstract = {Type-IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), which are characterized by strong interaction of their ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar matter (CSM), provide a unique opportunity to study the mass-loss history of massive stars shortly before their explosive death. We present the discovery and follow-up observations of an SN IIn, PTF 09uj, detected by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Serendipitous observations by Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths detected the rise of the SN light curve prior to the PTF discovery. The UV light curve of the SN rose fast, with a timescale of a few days, to a UV absolute AB magnitude of about -19.5. Modeling our observations, we suggest that the fast rise of the UV light curve is due to the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM (n ≈ 1010 cm-3). Furthermore, we find that prior to the explosion the progenitor went through a phase of high mass-loss rate (~0.1 M sun yr-1) that lasted for a few years. The decay rate of this SN was fast relative to that of other SNe IIn.},

	Abstract = {Analyses of supernovae (SNe) have revealed two main types of progenitors: exploding white dwarfs and collapsing massive stars. Here we describe SN 2002bj, which stands out as different from any SN reported to date. Its light curve rose and declined very rapidly, yet reached a peak intrinsic brightness greater than -18 magnitude. A spectrum obtained 7 days after discovery shows the presence of helium and intermediate-mass elements, yet no clear hydrogen or iron-peak elements. The spectrum only barely resembles that of a type Ia SN, with added carbon and helium. Its properties suggest that SN 2002bj may be representative of a class of progenitors that previously has been only hypothesized: a helium detonation on a white dwarf, ejecting a small envelope of material. New surveys should find many such objects, despite their scarcity.},

@article{Shen:2010,
	Abstract = {During the early evolution of an AM Canum Venaticorum system, helium is accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf under conditions suitable for unstable thermonuclear ignition. The turbulent motions induced by the convective burning phase in the He envelope become strong enough to influence the propagation of burning fronts and may result in the onset of a detonation. Such an outcome would yield radioactive isotopes and a faint rapidly rising thermonuclear ".Ia" supernova. In this paper, we present hydrodynamic explosion models and observable outcomes of these He shell detonations for a range of initial core and envelope masses. The peak UVOIR bolometric luminosities range by a factor of 10 (from 5 × 1041 to 5 × 1042 erg s-1), and the R-band peak varies from M  R,peak = -15 to -18. The rise times in all bands are very rapid (<10 days), but the decline rate is slower in the red than in the blue due to a secondary near-IR brightening. The nucleosynthesis primarily yields heavy alpha-chain elements (40Ca through 56Ni) and unburnt He. Thus, the spectra around peak light lack signs of intermediate-mass elements and are dominated by Ca II and Ti II features, with the caveat that our radiative transfer code does not include the nonthermal effects necessary to produce He features.},

	Abstract = {Helium that accretes onto a carbon/oxygen white dwarf in double white dwarf AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) binaries undergoes unstable thermonuclear flashes when the orbital period is in the 3.5-25 minute range. At the shortest orbital periods (and highest accretion rates, M˙>10-7 Msolar yr-1), the flashes are weak and likely lead to the helium equivalent of classical nova outbursts. However, as the orbit widens and M˙ drops, the mass required for the unstable ignition increases, leading to progressively more violent flashes up to a final flash with helium shell mass ~0.02-0.1 Msolar. The high pressures of these last flashes allow the burning to produce the radioactive elements 48Cr, 52Fe, and  56Ni that power a faint (MV=-15 to -18) and rapidly rising (few days) thermonuclear supernova. Current galactic AM CVn space densities imply one such explosion every 5,000-15,000 years in 1011 Msolar of old stars (~2%-6% of the Type Ia rate in E/SO galaxies). These ``.Ia'' supernovae (one-tenth as bright for one-tenth the time as a Type Ia supernovae) are excellent targets for deep (e.g., V=24) searches with nightly cadences, potentially yielding an all-sky rate of 1000 per year.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery, photometric, and spectroscopic follow-up observations of SN 2010X (PTF 10bhp). This supernova decays exponentially with tau d  = 5 days and rivals the current recordholder in speed, SN 2002bj. SN 2010X peaks at M  r  = -17 mag and has mean velocities of 10,000 km s-1. Our light curve modeling suggests a radioactivity-powered event and an ejecta mass of 0.16 M sun. If powered by Nickel, we show that the Nickel mass must be very small (≈0.02 M sun) and that the supernova quickly becomes optically thin to gamma-rays. Our spectral modeling suggests that SN 2010X and SN 2002bj have similar chemical compositions and that one of aluminum or helium is present. If aluminum is present, we speculate that this may be an accretion-induced collapse of an O-Ne-Mg white dwarf. If helium is present, all observables of SN 2010X are consistent with being a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on a white dwarf, a ".Ia" explosion. With the 1 day dynamic-cadence experiment on the Palomar Transient Factory, we expect to annually discover a few such events.},

@article{Bouwens:2014,
	Abstract = {We utilize a two-color Lyman-break selection criterion to search for z ~ 9-10 galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the CLASH program. A systematic search yields three z ~ 9-10 candidates. While we have already reported the most robust of these candidates, MACS1149-JD, two additional z ~ 9 candidates are also found and have H 160-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. A careful assessment of various sources of contamination suggests lsim1 contaminants for our z ~ 9-10 selection. To determine the implications of these search results for the luminosity function (LF) and star formation rate density at z ~ 9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantities in lensing fields. Our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing the number of z ~ 9-10 galaxy candidates found in CLASH with the number of galaxies in a slightly lower-redshift sample (after correcting for the differences in selection volumes), here taken to be z ~ 8. This procedure takes advantage of the fact that the relative volumes available for the z ~ 8 and z ~ 9-10 selections behind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing models. We find that the normalization of the UV LF at z ~ 9 is just 0.28-0.20+0.39× that at z ~ 8, which is ~1.4-0.8+3.0× lower than extrapolating z ~ 4-8 LF results. While consistent with the evolution in the UV LF seen at z ~ 4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z > 8. Compared to similar evolutionary findings from the HUDF, our result is less insensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independent sightlines on the high-redshift universe.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We present Advanced Camera for Surveys observations of MACS J1149.5+2223, an X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.544 discovered by the Massive Cluster Survey. The data reveal at least seven multiply imaged galaxies, three of which we have confirmed spectroscopically. One of these is a spectacular face-on spiral galaxy at z = 1.491, the four images of which are gravitationally magnified by 8 lsim mu lsim 23. We identify this as an L sstarf (MB sime -20.7), disk-dominated (B/T lsim 0.5) galaxy, forming stars at ~6 M sun yr-1. We use a robust sample of multiply imaged galaxies to constrain a parameterized model of the cluster mass distribution. In addition to the main cluster dark matter halo and the bright cluster galaxies, our best model includes three galaxy-group-sized halos. The relative probability of this model is P(N halo = 4)/P(N halo < 4) >= 1012 where N halo is the number of cluster/group-scale halos. In terms of sheer number of merging cluster/group-scale components, this is the most complex strong-lensing cluster core studied to date. The total cluster mass and fraction of that mass associated with substructures within R <= 500 kpc, are measured to be M tot = (6.7 $\pm$ 0.4) × 1014 M sun and f sub = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.12, respectively. Our model also rules out recent claims of a flat density profile at gsim7sigma confidence, thus highlighting the critical importance of spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies when modeling strong-lensing clusters. Overall our results attest to the efficiency of X-ray selection in finding the most powerful cluster lenses, including complicated merging systems.},

	Abstract = {We identify the largest known lensed images of a single spiral galaxy, lying close to the center of the distant cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.544). These images cover a total area of ~= 150'' and are magnified ~=200 times. Unusually, there is very little image distortion, implying that the central mass distribution is almost uniform over a wide area (r ~= 200 kpc) with a surface density equal to the critical density for lensing, corresponding to maximal lens magnification. Many fainter multiply lensed galaxies are also uncovered by our model, outlining a very large tangential critical curve, of radius r ~= 170 kpc, posing a potential challenge for the standard LCDM cosmology. Because of the uniform central mass distribution, a particularly clean measurement of the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy is possible here, for which we infer stars contribute most of the mass within a limiting radius of ~=30 kpc, with a mass-to-light ratio of M/LB ~= 4.5(M/L)sun. This cluster with its uniform and central mass distribution acts analogously to a regular magnifying glass, converging light without distorting the images, resulting in the most powerful lens yet discovered for accessing the faint high-z universe.},

	Abstract = {We present a strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 370 (z = 0.375) based on the recent multicolour images by Advanced Camera for Surveys obtained as part of the Early Release Observation (ERO) that followed the Hubble Service Mission #4. Back in 1987, the giant gravitational arc (z = 0.725) in Abell 370 was one of the first pieces of evidence that massive clusters are dense enough to act as strong gravitational lenses. The new observations reveal in detail its disclike morphology, and we show that it can be interpreted as a complex five-image configuration, with a total magnification factor of 32 +/- 4. Moreover, the high-resolution multicolour information allowed us to identify 10 multiply imaged background galaxies. We derive a mean Einstein radius of thetaE = 39 +/- 2 arcsec for a source redshift at z = 2, corresponding to a mass of M(<thetaE) = 2.82 +/- 0.15 × 1014Msolar and M(<250 kpc) = 3.8 +/- 0.2 × 1014Msolar, in good agreement with Subaru weak-lensing measurements. The typical mass model error is smaller than 5 per cent, a factor of 3 of improvement compared to the previous lensing analysis. Abell 370 mass distribution is confirmed to be bimodal with very small offset between the dark matter, the X-ray gas and the stellar mass. Combining this information with the velocity distribution reveals that Abell 370 is likely the merging of two equally massive clusters along the line of sight, explaining the very high-mass density necessary to efficiently produce strong lensing. These new observations stress the importance of multicolour imaging for the identification of multiple images which is key to determining an accurate mass model. The very large Einstein radius makes Abell 370 one of the best clusters to search for high-redshift galaxies through strong magnification in the central region.},

@article{Drout:2014,
	Abstract = {In the past decade, several rapidly evolving transients have been discovered whose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditional supernovae (SNe) models. The sample size of these objects has remained small due, at least in part, to the challenges of detecting short timescale transients with traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search within the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly evolving and luminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above half-maximum (t 1/2) of less than 12 days and -16.5 > M > -20 mag. This increases the number of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of three. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z = 0.275 and they all exploded in star-forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster rise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g P1 - r P1 lsim -0.2). Best-fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool with time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a blue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We find it difficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L > 1043 erg s-1), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients with an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of 56Ni. Rather, we find that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from the explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope that ejected very little (<0.03 M &sun;) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a dense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. After calculating the detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the PS1-MDS we find a volumetric rate of 4800-8000 events yr-1 Gpc-3 (4%-7% of the core-collapse SN rate at z = 0.2).},

	Abstract = {We present a UV to mid-infrared multi-wavelength catalog in the CANDELS/GOODS-S field, combining the newly obtained CANDELS HST/WFC3 F105W, F125W, and F160W data with existing public data. The catalog is based on source detection in the WFC3 F160W band. The F160W mosaic includes the data from CANDELS deep and wide observations as well as previous ERS and HUDF09 programs. The mosaic reaches a 5sigma limiting depth (within an aperture of radius 0.''17) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 AB for CANDELS wide, deep, and HUDF regions, respectively. The catalog contains 34,930 sources with the representative 50% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 AB in the F160W band for the three regions. In addition to WFC3 bands, the catalog also includes data from UV (U band from both CTIO/MOSAIC and VLT/VIMOS), optical (HST/ACS F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and infrared (HST/WFC3 F098M, VLT/ISAAC Ks, VLT/HAWK-I Ks, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 mum) observations. The catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison with other published catalogs, zero-point offsets determined from the best-fit templates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observed objects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. The catalog is able to detect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of 1010 M &sun; at a 50% completeness level to z ~ 3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and 7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. As an example of application, the catalog is used to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z ~ 2-4 via the Balmer break. It is also used to study the color-magnitude diagram of galaxies at 0 < z < 4.},

	Abstract = {We explore the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star formation activity on the infrared (0.3-1000 mum) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of luminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. We have compiled a large sample of 151 galaxies selected at 24 mum (S 24 >~ 100 muJy) in the GOODS-N and ECDFS fields for which we have deep Spitzer IRS spectroscopy, allowing us to decompose the mid-IR spectrum into contributions from star formation and AGN activity. A significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an AGN (>50% of the mid-IR luminosity) in the mid-IR. Based on the mid-IR classification, we divide our full sample into four sub-samples: z ~ 1 star-forming (SF) sources, z ~ 2 SF sources, AGNs with clear 9.7 mum silicate absorption, and AGNs with featureless mid-IR spectra. From our large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, including deep Herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum, we use 95 galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite SED for each sub-sample. We then fit a two-temperature component modified blackbody to the SEDs. We find that the IR SEDs have similar cold dust temperatures, regardless of the mid-IR power source, but display a marked difference in the warmer dust temperatures. We calculate the average effective temperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 K) difference between the SF and AGN systems. We compare our composite SEDs to local templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce the mid-IR features and dust temperatures of our high-redshift systems. High-redshift IR luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than their local counterparts. We find that a full suite of photometry spanning the IR peak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperature components in high-redshift IR luminous galaxies.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

This survey, named HUGS (Hawk-I UDS and GOODS Survey), provides deep, high-quality imaging in the K and Y bands over the portions of the UKIDSS UDS and GOODS-South fields covered by the CANDELS HST WFC3/IR survey. In this paper we describe the survey strategy, the observational campaign, the data reduction process, and the data quality. We show that, thanks to exquisite image quality and extremely long exposure times, HUGS delivers the deepest K-band images ever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and in general ideally complements the CANDELS data set in terms of image quality and depth. In the GOODS-S field, the K-band observations cover the whole CANDELS area with a complex geometry made of 6 different, partly overlapping pointings, in order to best match the deep and wide areas of CANDELS imaging. In the deepest region (which includes most of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field) exposure times exceed 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1 - sigma magnitude limit per square arcsec of ~=28.0 AB mag. The seeing is exceptional and homogeneous across the various pointings, confined to the range 0.38-0.43 arcsec. In the UDS field the survey is about one magnitude shallower (to match the correspondingly shallower depth of the CANDELS images) but includes also Y-band band imaging (which, in the UDS, was not provided by the CANDELS WFC3/IR imaging). In the K-band, with an average exposure time of 13 hours, and seeing in the range 0.37-0.43 arcsec, the 1 - sigma limit per square arcsec in the UDS imaging is ~=27.3 AB mag. In the Y-band, with an average exposure time ~=8 h, and seeing in the range 0.45-0.5 arcsec, the imaging yields a 1 - sigma limit per square arcsec of ~=28.3 AB mag. We show that the HUGS observations are well matched to the depth of the CANDELS WFC3/IR data, since the majority of even the faintest galaxies detected in the CANDELS H-band images are also detected in HUGS. Finally we present the K-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the HUGS data from the two fields. We show that the slope of the number counts depends sensitively on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impact on the estimated extra-galactic background light.

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of high-redshift supernovae is potentially an important source of uncertainty when cosmological parameters are being derived from the measured brightness of Type Ia supernovae, especially in deep surveys with scarce statistics. Photometric and spectroscopic measurements of foreground galaxies along the lines of sight of 33 supernovae discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope, both core-collapse and Type Ia, are used to model the magnification probability distributions of the sources. Modelling galaxy halos with SIS or NFW profiles and using M/L scaling laws provided by the Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, we find clear evidence for supernovae with lensing (de)magnification. However, the magnification distribution of the Type Ia supernovae used to determine cosmological distances matches very well the expectations for an unbiased sample; i.e., their mean magnification factor is consistent with unity. Our results show that the lensing distortions of the supernova brightness can be well understood for the GOODS sample and that correcting for this effect has a negligible impact on the derived cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {Observation of the expansion history of the universe allows exploration of the physical properties and energy density of the universe's various constituents. Standardizable candles such as Type Ia supernovae remain one of the most promising and robust tools in this endeavor by allowing for a direct measure of the luminosity distance-redshift curve and thereby producing detailed studies of the dark energy responsible for the universe's currently accelerating expansion. As such observations are pushed to higher redshifts, the observed flux is increasingly affected by gravitational lensing magnification due to intervening structure along the line of sight. We simulate and analyze the non-Gaussian probability distribution function of deamplification and amplification due to lensing of standard candles, quantify the effect of a convolution over many independent sources (which acts to restore the intrinsic average [unlensed] luminosity due to flux conservation), and compute the additional uncertainty due to lensing on derived cosmological parameters. We find that, in the case of large numbers of sources, the lensing distribution along any particular line of sight can be approximated by a Gaussian with standard deviation given by sigmaeff=0.088z as a function of redshift z. The resulting ``degradation factor'' due to lensing is a factor of 3 reduction in the effective number of usable supernovae at z=1.5 (for sources with intrinsic flux dispersion of 10%).},

	Abstract = {Modern applications of strong gravitational lensing require the ability to use precise and varied observational data to constrain complex lens models. I discuss two sets of computational methods for lensing calculations. The first is a new algorithm for solving the lens equation for general mass distributions. This algorithm makes it possible to apply arbitrarily complicated models to observed lenses. The second is an evaluation of techniques for using observational data including positions, fluxes, and time delays of point-like images, as well as maps of extended images, to constrain models of strong lenses. The techniques presented here are implemented in a flexible and user-friendly software package called gravlens, which is made available to the community.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model to describe the galaxy-dark matter connection across cosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance-matching technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z ~ 4, the conditional SMF at z ~ 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z ~ 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z ~ 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M 0.3 and M gsim 4.0 at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M *, c /M reveals a maximum of ~0.03 at a halo mass M ~ 1011.8 h -1 M &sun;, much lower than the universal baryon fraction (~0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M *, c /M remains close to ~0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M *, c /M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches ~1012 h -1 M &sun;, at which point M *, c /M ~ 0.03. Once M >~ 1012 h -1 M &sun;, there is little growth in M *, c , causing the ratio M *, c /M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z <~ 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z <~ 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10% of M *, c  in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a LambdaCDM cosmology.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {A stellar spectral flux library of wide spectral coverage and an example of its application are presented. The new library consists of 131 flux-calibrated spectra, encompassing all normal spectral types and luminosity classes at solar abundance, and metal-weak and metal-rich F-K dwarf and G-K giant components. Each library spectrum was formed by combining data from several sources overlapping in wavelength coverage. The SIMBAD database, measured colors, and line strengths were used to check that each input component has closely similar stellar type. The library has complete spectral coverage from 1150 to 10620 {\AA} for all components and to 25000 {\AA} for about half of them, mainly later types of solar abundance. Missing spectral coverage in the infrared currently consists of a smooth energy distribution formed from standard colors for the relevant types. The library is designed to permit inclusion of additional digital spectra, particularly of non-solar abundance stars in the infrared, as they become available. The library spectra are each given as F_lambda versus lambda, from 1150 to 25000 {\AA} in steps of 5 {\AA}. A program to combine the library spectra in the ratios appropriate to a selected isochrone is described and an example of a spectral component signature of a composite population of solar age and metallicity is illustrated. The library spectra and associated tables are available as text files by remote electronic access.},

	Abstract = {Aims. We present and release photometric redshifts for a uniquely large and deep sample of 522286 objects with i'_AB<= 25 in the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) "Deep Survey" fields D1, D2, D3, and D4, which cover a total effective area of 3.2 $\,^{\circ}$^2.  Methods: . We use 3241 spectroscopic redshifts with 0 <= z <= 5 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a calibration and training set to derive these photometric redshifts. Using the "Le Phare" photometric redshift code, we developed a robust calibration method based on an iterative zero-point refinement combined with a template optimisation procedure and the application of a Bayesian approach. This method removes systematic trends in the photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic errors (by a factor of 2), a significant improvement over traditional methods. We use our unique spectroscopic sample to present a detailed assessment of the robustness of the photometric redshift sample. Results: . For a sample selected at i'_AB<= 24, we reach a redshift accuracy of sigmaDelta z/(1+z)=0.029 with eta=3.8% of catastrophic errors (eta is defined strictly as those objects with |Delta z|/(1+z) > 0.15). The reliability of our photometric redshifts decreases for faint objects: we find sigmaDelta z/(1+z)=0.025, 0.034 and eta=1.9%, 5.5% for samples selected at i'_AB=17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 22% of the spectroscopic sample, they are responsible for 50% of the catastrophic errors. An analysis as a function of redshift demonstrates that our photometric redshifts work best in the redshift range 0.2<= z <= 1.5. We find an excellent agreement between the photometric and the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions at i'_AB<= 24. Finally, we compare the redshift distributions of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing that cosmic variance is still present on fields of 0.7-0.9 deg^2. These photometric redshifts are made publicly available at http://terapix.iap.fr (complete ascii catalogues) and http://cencos.oamp.fr/cencos/CFHTLS/ (searchable database interface).},

	Abstract = {The evolution of galaxy clustering from z=0 to z~=4.5 is analysed using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than IAB<=28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North. The reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving correlation length r0 has a small decrease in the range 0<~z<~1 followed by an increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of Cold Dark Matter scenarios, including Einstein-de Sitter models, an open model and a flat model with non-zero cosmological constant. Comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de Sitter universe, we obtain b~=2.5 at z~=2 and b~=5 at z~=4. These results support theoretical scenarios of biased galaxy formation in which the galaxies observed at high redshift are preferentially located in more massive haloes. Moreover, they suggest that the usual parameterization of the clustering evolution as xi(r,z)=xi(r,0)(1+z)-(3+ε) is not a good description for any value of ε. Comparison of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z~=3 with those reported by Adelberger et al. and Giavalisco et al., based on a different selection, suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at z~=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted in the frame of the various cosmologies considered here. At z~=4, the strong clustering observed in the Hubble Deep Field requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.},

	Abstract = {We find that spectroscopically peculiar subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) come from an old population. Of the 16 subluminous SNe Ia known, 10 are found in E/S0 galaxies, and the remainder are found in early-type spiral galaxies. The probability that this is a chance occurrence is only 0.2%. The finding that subluminous SNe Ia are associated with an older stellar population indicates that for a sufficiently large look-back time (already accessible in current high-redshift searches) they will not be found. Due to a scarcity in old populations, hydrogen and helium main-sequence stars and He red giant stars that undergo Roche lobe overflow are unlikely to be the progenitors of subluminous SNe Ia. Earlier findings that overluminous SNe Ia [Deltam15(B)<~0.95] come from a young progenitor population are confirmed. The fact that subluminous SNe Ia and overluminous SNe Ia come from different progenitor populations and also have different properties is a prediction of the CO white dwarf merger progenitor scenario.},

	Abstract = {We probe the systematic uncertainties from the 113 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) sample along with 197 SN Ia from a combination of low-redshift surveys. The companion paper by Rest et al. describes the photometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the PS1 sample. The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples. We increase the sample of observed Calspec standards from 7 to 10 used to define the PS1 calibration system. The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag are recovered. We find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colors and reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insignificant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037 &#177; 0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses. Assuming flatness and including systematic uncertainties in our analysis of only SNe measurements, we find w =-1.120+0.360-0.206(Stat) +0.269-0.291(Sys). With additional constraints from Baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background (CMB) (Planck) and H 0 measurements, we find w=-1.166+0.072-0.069 and Omega _m=0.280+0.013-0.012 (statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature). The significance of the inconsistency with w = &#x2013;1 depends on whether we use Planck or Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measurements of the CMB: wBAO+H0+SN+{WMAP}=-1.124+0.083-0.065.},

	Abstract = {We present griz P1 light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia 0.03 < z < 0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 yr of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2% without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w=-1.120+0.360-0.206{(Stat)} +0.269-0.291{(Sys)}. When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H 0, the analysis yields Omega _M=0.280+0.013-0.012 and w=-1.166+0.072-0.069 including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of &#x2013;1 at the 2.3sigma level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H 0 constraint, though it is strongest when including the H 0 constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w=-1.124+0.083-0.065, which diminishes the discord to <2sigma. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat LambdaCDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with ~three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) of the transient source PTF11agg, which is distinguished by three primary characteristics: (1) bright (R peak = 18.3 mag), rapidly fading (DeltaR = 4 mag in Deltat = 2 days) optical transient emission; (2) a faint (R = 26.2 $\pm$ 0.2 mag), blue (g' - R = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.29 mag) quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long, scintillating radio transient. We argue that these observed properties are inconsistent with any known class of Galactic transients (flare stars, X-ray binaries, dwarf novae), and instead suggest a cosmological origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such distances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence of relativistic ejecta. The observed properties are all consistent with the population of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), marking the first time such an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of a high-energy trigger. We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to PTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore consider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a high-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an "orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressed high-energy emission). The observed optical and radio light curves appear inconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglow models. The simplest explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis long-duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was simply missed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitous discovery by PTF and find that it is quite small (≈2.6%). While not definitive, we nonetheless speculate that PTF11agg may represent a new, more common (>4 times the on-axis GRB rate at 90% confidence) class of relativistic outbursts lacking associated high-energy emission. If so, such sources will be uncovered in large numbers by future wide-field optical and radio transient surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present a search for fast optical transients (tau ~ 0.5 hr-1 day) using repeated observations of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1/MDS) fields. Our search takes advantage of the consecutive g P1 r P1 observations (16.5 minutes in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, with non-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. We identify 19 transients brighter than 22.5 AB mag (S/N >~ 10). Of these, 11 events exhibit quiescent counterparts in the deep PS1/MDS templates that we identify as M4-M9 dwarfs at d ≈ 0.2-1.2 kpc. The remaining eight transients lack quiescent counterparts, exhibit mild but significant astrometric shifts between the g P1 and r P1 images, colors of (g - r)P1 ≈ 0.5-0.8 mag, non-varying light curves, and locations near the ecliptic plane with solar elongations of about 130$\,^{\circ}$, which are all indicative of main-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. With identifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit of R FOT(tau ~ 0.5 hr) <~ 0.12 deg-2 day-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rate of extragalactic fast transients at <~ 22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lower than previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~1 day is R FOT <~ 2.4 × 10-3 deg-2 day-1. To convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore the expected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by various mechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to M ≈ -10 to ≈ - 14 mag for a timescale of ~0.5 hr to ~1 day, while relativistic sources (e.g., gamma-ray bursts, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities. The resulting volumetric rates are <~ 13 Mpc-3 yr-1 (M ≈ -10 mag), <~ 0.05 Mpc-3 yr-1 (M ≈ -14 mag), and <~ 10-6 Mpc-3 yr-1 (M ≈ -24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and gamma-ray burst rates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required to provide meaningful constraints. Motivated by the results of our search, we discuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope main survey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foreground contaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensive follow-up observations.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed strong-lensing, weak-lensing and X-ray analysis of Abell 2744 (z= 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known. It appears to have unleashed 'dark', 'ghost', 'bullet' and 'stripped' substructures, each ˜1014 M&sun;. The phenomenology is complex and will present a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we identify 34 strongly lensed images of 11 galaxies around the massive Southern 'core'. Combining this with weak-lensing data from HST, VLT and Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We also perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our analyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern substructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet Cluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas and lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent constraint on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter particles sigma/m < 3 $\pm$ 1 cm2 g-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark matter and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances. Most curiously, the 'ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the 'dark' clump (primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced 'ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of components with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by follow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a second 'bullet' clump in the North and an extremely 'stripped' clump to the West. The latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matter and X-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.},

	Abstract = {We present a high-precision mass model of galaxy cluster Abell 2744, based on a strong-gravitational-lensing analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data, which now include both Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide-Field Camera 3 observations to the final depth. Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth of the visible and near-infrared data, we identify 33 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 51, comprising 159 individual lensed images. In the process, we correct previous erroneous identifications and positions of multiple systems in the northern part of the cluster core. With the Lenstool software and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster using two cluster-scale dark matter halos plus galaxy-scale halos for the cluster members. Our best-fit model predicts image positions with an RMS error of 0.69", which constitutes an improvement by almost a factor of two over previous parametric models of this cluster. We measure the total projected mass inside a 200kpc aperture as ($2.156\pm 0.003$)$\times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$, thus reaching 1% level precision for the second time, following the recent HFF measurement of MACSJ0416.1-2403. Importantly, the higher quality of the mass model translates into an overall improvement by a factor of 4 of the derived magnification factor for the high-redshift lensed background galaxies. Together with our previous HFF gravitational lensing analysis, this work demonstrates that the HFF data enables high-precision mass measurements for massive galaxy clusters and the derivation of robust magnification maps to probe the early Universe.},

	Abstract = {Context. Use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as distance indicators has proven to be a powerful technique for measuring the dark-energy equation of state. However, recent studies have highlighted potential biases correlated with the global properties of their host galaxies, large enough to induce systematic errors into such cosmological measurements if not properly treated.  Aims: We study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to SNe Ia in order to analyze relations between the properties of SN Ia events and environments where their progenitors most likely formed. In this paper we focus on local Halpha emission as an indicator of young progenitor environments.  Methods: The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral field spectroscopy. These observations enabled the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measured or set limits on Halpha emission, used as a tracer of ongoing star formation, within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia with accurate luminosity, color, and stretch measurements.  Results: Our local star formation measurements provide several critical new insights. We find that SNe Ia with local Halpha emission are redder by 0.036 $\pm$ 0.017 mag, and that the previously noted correlation between stretch and host mass is driven entirely by the SNe Ia coming from locally passive environments, in particular at the low-stretch end. There is no such trend for SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments. Our most important finding is that the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local Halpha emission is 0.094 $\pm$ 0.031 mag fainter on average than for those without. This offset arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, with one mode being shared by SNe Ia in all environments and the other one exclusive to SNe Ia in locally passive environments. This structure also explains the previously known host-mass bias. We combine the star formation dependence of this bimodality with the cosmic star formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. The strong change predicted is confirmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature.  Conclusions: The environmental dependences in SN Ia Hubble residuals and color found here point to remaining systematic errors in the standardization of SNe Ia. In particular, the observed brightness offset associated with local Halpha emission is predicted to cause a significant bias in current measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these effects offers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes. For instance, we note that the SNe Ia associated with local Halpha emission are more homogeneous, resulting in a brightness dispersion of only 0.105 $\pm$ 0.012 mag.

	Abstract = {The luminosities of Type Ia supernovae (SN), the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, vary systematically with their intrinsic color and light-curve decline rate. These relationships have been used to calibrate their luminosities to within ~0.14-0.20 mag from broadband optical light curves, yielding individual distances accurate to ~7-10%. Here we identify a subset of SN Ia that erupt in environments having high ultraviolet surface brightness and star-formation surface density. When we apply a steep model extinction law, these SN can be calibrated to within ~0.065-0.075 mag, corresponding to ~3-4% in distance -- the best yet with SN Ia by a substantial margin. The small scatter suggests that variations in only one or two progenitor properties account for their light-curve-width/color/luminosity relation.},

@article{Hakobyan:2012,
	Abstract = {Context. In this first paper of a series, we report the creation of large and well-defined database that combines extensive new measurements and a literature search of 3876 supernovae (SNe) and their 3679 host galaxies located in the sky area covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8).  Aims. This database should be much larger than previous ones, and should contain a homogenous set of global parameters of SN hosts, including morphological classifications and measures of nuclear activity.  Methods. The measurements of apparent magnitudes, diameters (D25), axial ratios (b/a), and position angles (PA) of SN host galaxies were made using the images extracted from the SDSS g-band. For each host galaxy, we analyzed RGB images of the SDSS to accurately measure the position of its nucleus to provide the SDSS name. With these images, we also provide the host galaxy's morphological type, and note if it has a bar, a disturbed disk, and whether it is part of an interacting or merging system. In addition, the SDSS nuclear spectra were analyzed to diagnose the central power source of the galaxies. Special attention was paid to collect accurate data on the spectroscopic classes, coordinates, offsets of SNe, and heliocentric redshifts of the host galaxies.  Results. Identification of the host galaxy sample is 91% complete (with 3536 SNe in 3340 hosts), of which the SDSS names of ~1100 anonymous hosts are listed for the first time. The morphological classification is available for 2104 host galaxies, including 73 (56) hosts in interacting (merging) systems. The total sample of host galaxies collects heliocentric redshifts for 3317 (~90%) galaxies. The g-band magnitudes, D25, b/a, and PA are available for 2030 hosts of the morphologically classified sample of galaxies. Nuclear activity measures are provided for 1189 host galaxies. We analyze and discuss many selection effects and biases that can significantly affect any future analysis of our sample.  Conclusions. The creation of this large database will help to better understand how the different types of SNe are correlated with the properties of the nuclei and global physical parameters of the host galaxies, and minimize possible selection effects and errors that often arise when data are selected from different sources and catalogs.

	Abstract = {This paper presents spectroscopy of supernovae (SNe) discovered in the first season of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II SN Survey. This program searches for and measures multi-band light curves of SNe in the redshift range z = 0.05-0.4, complementing existing surveys at lower and higher redshifts. Our goal is to better characterize the SN population, with a particular focus on SNe Ia, improving their utility as cosmological distance indicators and as probes of dark energy. Our SN spectroscopy program features rapid-response observations using telescopes of a range of apertures, and provides confirmation of the SN and host-galaxy types as well as precise redshifts. We describe here the target identification and prioritization, data reduction, redshift measurement, and classification of 129 SNe Ia, 16 spectroscopically probable SNe Ia, 7 SNe Ib/c, and 11 SNe II from the first season. We also describe our efforts to measure and remove the substantial host-galaxy contamination existing in the majority of our SN spectra.},

@article{Shaw:2007,
	Abstract = {Bayesian model selection provides the cosmologist with an exacting tool to distinguish between competing models based purely on the data via the Bayesian evidence. Previous methods to calculate this quantity either lacked general applicability or were computationally demanding. However, nested sampling, which was recently applied successfully to cosmology by Muhkerjee et al., overcomes both of these impediments. Their implementation restricts the parameter space sampled, and thus improves the efficiency, using a shrinking ellipsoidal bound in the n-dimensional parameter space encompassing parameter samples above an increasing likelihood threshold. However, if the likelihood function contains any multimodality, separated over a significant portion of the parameter space, then the ellipse is prevented from constraining the sampling region efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a method of clustered nested sampling whereby multiple ellipsoidal clusters can form over any region of the prior volume - thus improving the efficiency by a factor which is equal to the ratio of the volumes enclosed by the set of small clustered ellipsoids and the large single ellipse that would necessarily be required without clustering. In addition, we have implemented a method for determining the expectation and variance of the final evidence value without the need to use sampling error from repetitions of the algorithm; this further reduces the computational load by at least an order of magnitude. It should be noted that this latter development is relevant for all cosmological applications, not just for those involving multimodal posteriors. We have applied our algorithm to a pair of toy models and one cosmological example where we demonstrate that the number of likelihood evaluations required is ~ 4 per cent of that necessary using previous algorithms. We have produced a FORTRAN library containing our routines which can be called from any sampling code, in addition for convenience we have incorporated it into the popular COSMOMC code as COSMOCLUST. Both are available for download at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/cosmoclust.},

	Abstract = {Context: Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of stars in the Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of galactic disk evolution. Understanding and minimising systematic errors and sample selection biases in the data is crucial for their interpretation.   Aims: We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvbybeta photometry into T_eff, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstr{\"o}m et al. 2004; GCS) in terms of the evolution of the disk.   Methods: We use recent V-K photometry, angular diameters, high-resolution spectroscopy, Hipparcos parallaxes, and extensive numerical simulations to re-examine and verify the temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening calibrations for the uvbybeta system. We also highlight the selection effects inherent in the apparent-magnitude limited GCS sample.   Results: We substantially improve the T_eff and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars, where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. A slight offset of the GCS photometry and the non-standard helium abundance of the Hyades invalidate its use for checking metallicity or age scales; however, the distances, reddenings, metallicities, and age scale for GCS field stars require minor corrections only. Our recomputed ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined. Conclusions: The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (sigma_intrinsic = 0.20 dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life; specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

	Abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2007if, an overluminous (MV = -20.4), red (B - V = 0.16 at B-band maximum), slow-rising (t rise = 24 days) type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a very faint (Mg = -14.10) host galaxy. A spectrum at 5 days past B-band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si II and C II at ~9000 km s-1. A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na I D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in I band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN 2007if also displays a plateau in the Si II velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the Si II velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN 2007if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 $\pm$ 0.2 M sun, with 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 M sun of 56Ni and with 0.3-0.5 M sun in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia.},

@article{Foley:2010,
	Abstract = {SN 2006bt displays characteristics unlike those of any other known Type Ia supernova (SN Ia). We present optical light curves and spectra of SN 2006bt which demonstrate the peculiar nature of this object. SN 2006bt has broad, slowly declining light curves indicative of a hot, high-luminosity SN, but lacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity SNe Ia. Its spectra are similar to those of low-luminosity SNe Ia, containing features that are only present in cool SN photospheres. Light-curve fitting methods suggest that SN 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, it occurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong Na D absorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxy dust absorption. C II is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at a much lower velocity than other elements. The progenitor was likely very old, being a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recent star formation. SNe Ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameter family, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distance indicators. SN 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normal light curves allowed SN 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. We generate mock SN Ia data sets which indicate that contamination by similar objects will both increase the scatter of a SN Ia Hubble diagram and systematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. However, spectra and rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identify and eliminate such objects.},

	Abstract = {The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) was a five-year observational survey conducted at Las Campanas Observatory that obtained, among other things, high-quality light curves of ~100 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Presented here is the second data release of nearby SN Ia photometry consisting of 50 objects, with a subset of 45 having near-infrared follow-up observations. Thirty-three objects have optical pre-maximum coverage with a subset of 15 beginning at least five days before maximum light. In the near-infrared, 27 objects have coverage beginning before the epoch of B-band maximum, with a subset of 13 beginning at least five days before maximum. In addition, we present results of a photometric calibration program to measure the CSP optical (uBgVri) bandpasses with an accuracy of ~1%. Finally, we report the discovery of a second SN Ia, SN 2006ot, similar in its characteristics to the peculiar SN 2006bt.},

	Abstract = {PTF10ops is a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), whose light curve and spectral properties place it outside the current SN Ia subtype classifications. Its spectra display the characteristic lines of subluminous SNe Ia, but it has a normal-width light curve with a long rise time, typical of normal-luminosity SNe Ia. The early-time optical spectra of PTF10ops were modelled using a spectral fitting code and found to have all the lines typically seen in subluminous SNe Ia, without the need to invoke more uncommon elements. The host galaxy environment of PTF10ops is also unusual with no galaxy detected at the position of the SN down to an absolute limiting magnitude of r>=-12.0 mag, but a very massive galaxy is present at a separation of ˜148 kpc and at the same redshift as suggested by the SN spectral features. The progenitor of PTF10ops is most likely a very old star, possibly in a low-metallicity environment, which affects its explosion mechanism and observational characteristics. PTF10ops does not easily fit into any of the current models of either subluminous or normal SN Ia progenitor channels.},

@article{Smith:2012,
	Abstract = {Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Supernova Survey-II (SDSS-II SN Survey), we measure the rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of galaxy properties at intermediate redshift. A sample of 342 SNe Ia with 0.05 < z < 0.25 is constructed. Using broadband photometry and redshifts, we use the P{\'E}GASE.2 spectral energy distributions to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star formation rates (SFRs). We find that the rate of SNe Ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher (by a factor of ~30) in highly star-forming galaxies compared to passive galaxies. When parameterizing the SN Ia rate (SNRIa) based on host galaxy properties, we find that the rate of SNe Ia in passive galaxies is not linearly proportional to the stellar mass; instead an SNRIavpropM 0.68 is favored. However, such a parameterization does not describe the observed SNRIa in star-forming galaxies. The SNRIa in star-forming galaxies is well fitted by SNRIa = (0.41 $\pm$ 0.15) × 10-10 M 0.72 $\pm$ 0.15 + (0.65 $\pm$ 0.25) × 10-3SFR1.01 $\pm$ 0.22 (statistical errors only), where M is the host galaxy stellar mass (in M &sun;) and SFR is the SFR (in M &sun; yr-1). We show that our results, for SNe Ia in passive galaxies, are consistent with those at higher redshifts (favoring SNRIavpropM) when accounting for the difference in the ages of our galaxies. This suggests that the rate of SNe Ia is correlated with the age of the stellar population. The MLCS extinction parameter, AV , is similar in passive and moderately star-forming galaxies, but we find indications that it is smaller, on average, in highly star-forming galaxies. This result appears to be driven by a deficit of the reddest (AV > 0.15) SNe Ia in highly star-forming galaxies. We consider that the high levels of dust in these systems may be obscuring the reddest and faintest SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {Aims: To estimate the mean masses of oxygen and iron ejected per each type of supernovae (SNe) event from observations of the elemental abundance patterns in the Galactic disk and constrain the relevant SNe progenitor models.  Methods: We undertake a statistical analysis of the radial abundance distributions in the Galactic disk within a theoretical framework for Galactic chemical evolution which incorporates the influence of spiral arms. This framework has been shown to recover the non-linear behaviour in radial gradients, the mean masses of oxygen and iron ejected during SNe explosions to be estimated, and constraints to be placed on SNe progenitor models.  Results: (i) The mean mass of oxygen ejected per core-collapse SNe (CC SNe) event (which are concentrated within spiral arms) is ~0.27 M&sun;; (ii) the mean mass of iron ejected by tardy Type Ia SNe (SNeIa, whose progenitors are older/longer-lived stars with ages ≳100 Myr and up to several Gyr, which do not concentrate within spiral arms) is ~0.58 M&sun;; (iii) the upper mass of iron ejected by prompt SNeIa (SNe whose progenitors are younger/shorter-lived stars with ages ≲100 Myr, which are concentrated within spiral arms) is <=0.23 M&sun; per event; (iv) the corresponding mean mass of iron produced by CC SNe is <=0.04 M&sun; per event; (v) short-lived SNe (core-collapse or prompt SNeIa) supply ~85% of the Galactic disk's iron.  Conclusions: The inferred low mean mass of oxygen ejected per CC SNe event implies a low upper mass limit for the corresponding progenitors of ~23 M&sun;, otherwise the Galactic disk would be overabundant in oxygen. This inference is the consequence of the non-linear dependence between the upper limit of the progenitor initial mass and the mean mass of oxygen ejected per CC SNe explosion. The low mean mass of iron ejected by prompt SNeIa, relative to the mass produced by tardy SNeIa (~2.5 times lower), prejudices the idea that both sub-populations of SNeIa have the same physical nature. We suggest that, perhaps, prompt SNeIa are more akin to CC SNe, and discuss the implications of such a suggestion.},

@article{Kistler:2013,
	Abstract = {The metallicity of a star strongly affects both its evolution and the properties of the stellar remnant that results from its demise. It is generally accepted that stars with initial masses below ~8 M &sun; leave behind white dwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rate of SNe Ia. We propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is to significantly increase the SN Ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, in contrast to previous expectations. This is because lower-metallicity stars leave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring to explosion. We first model SN Ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and ages alone, finding that the elevation in the rate of SNe Ia in lower-mass galaxies measured by Lick Observatory SN Search is readily explained. However, we then see that models incorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. Using the same parameters to estimate the cosmic SN Ia rate, we again find good agreement with data up to z ≈ 2. We suggest that this degeneracy warrants more detailed examination of host galaxy metallicities. We discuss additional implications, including for hosts of high-z SNe Ia, the SN Ia delay time distribution, super-Chandrasekhar SNe, and cosmology.},

	Abstract = {The rate evolution of subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is presented using data from the Supernova Legacy Survey. This sub-sample represents the faint and rapidly declining light curves of the observed SN Ia population here defined by low-stretch values (s <= 0.8). Up to redshift z = 0.6, we find 18 photometrically identified subluminous SNe Ia, of which six have spectroscopic redshift (and three are spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia). The evolution of the subluminous volumetric rate is constant or slightly decreasing with redshift, in contrast to the increasing SN Ia rate found for the normal stretch population, although a rising behavior is not conclusively ruled out. The subluminous sample is mainly found in early-type galaxies with little or no star formation, so that the rate evolution is consistent with a galactic mass-dependent behavior: r(z) = A × Mg , with A = (1.1 $\pm$ 0.3) × 10-14 SNe yr-1 M -1 sun.

	Abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z ˜ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 M&sun;. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z < 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

	Abstract = {The metal content of clusters of galaxies and its relation to their stellar content is revisited making use of a cluster sample for which all four basic parameters are homogeneously measured within consistent radii, namely core-excised mass-weighted metallicity plus total, stellar and ICM masses. For clusters of total mass $M_{500} >$ $\sim 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ nice agreement is found between their iron content and what expected from empirical supernova yields. For the same clusters, there also appears to be at least as much iron in the intracluster medium (ICM) as there is still locked into stars (i.e., the ICM/stars metal share is about unity). However, for more massive clusters the stellar mass fraction appears to drop substantially without being accompanied by a drop in the ICM metallicity, thus generating a major tension with the nucleosynthesis expectation and inflating the metal share to extremely high values (up to $\sim 6$). Various possible solutions of this conundrum are discussed, but are all considered either astrophysically implausible, or lacking an independent observational support. For this reason we still entertain the possibility that even some of the best cluster data may be faulty, though we are not able to identify any obvious bias. Finally, based on the stellar mass-metallicity relation for local galaxies we estimate the contribution of galaxies to the ICM enrichment as a function of their mass, concluding that even the most massive galaxies must have lost a major fraction of the metals they have produced.},

	Abstract = {We study how Type Ia/II supernova rates at various redshifts can be used to constrain the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) history. We use a spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution which provides a self-consistent description of global properties of local galaxies. We have chosen two CSFR histories, with and without dust extinction, both normalized in order to reproduce the observed comoving luminosity densities at different wavelengths. We show that as expected, the SNII rates provide a direct measurement of the instantaneous CSFR, whereas the SNIa rate depends on the CSFR history during the past few Gyrs. Therefore the SNIa rate detected up to z { ~ } 1 is able to provide new insight on the CSFR at higher redshift. The comparison with the data are in good agreement with both local and high-z measurement and provides an additional evidence of the validity of the CSFR up to z = 1, but suggests values at z > 1 higher than those of Madau et al. (1996) and consistent with the presence of extinction. We also show that Type Ia supernova observations at z{ ~ } 1 can already put constraints on the still puzzling nature of Type Ia progenitors.},

	Abstract = {Determination of the rates at which Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) occur in the early universe can give signatures of the time spent by the binary progenitor systems to reach explosion and of the geometry of the universe. Observations made within the Supernova Cosmology Project are already providing the first numbers. Here it is shown that, for any assumed SNe Ia progenitor, SNe Ia counts up to mR~=23-26 are useful tests of the SNe Ia progenitor systems and cosmological tracers of a possible nonzero value of the cosmological constant, Lambda. The SNe Ia counts at high redshifts compare differently with those at lower redshifts depending on the cosmological model. A flat, OmegaLambda-dominated universe would show a more significant increase of the SNe Ia counts at z~1 than a flat, OmegaM=1 universe. Here we consider three sorts of universes: a flat universe with H0=65 km s-1 Mpc-1, OmegaM=1.0, OmegaLambda=0.0 an open universe with H0=65 km s-1 Mpc-1, OmegaM=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.0 and a flat, Lambda-dominated universe with H0=65 km s-1 Mpc-1, OmegaM=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7. On the other hand, the SNe Ia counts from one class of binary progenitors (double-degenerate systems) should not increase steeply in the z=0-1 range, contrary to what should be seen for other binary progenitors. A measurement of the SNe Ia counts up to z~1 is within reach of ongoing SNe Ia searches at high redshifts.},

@article{Pakmor:2011,
	Abstract = {Context. The origin of subluminous Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has long eluded any explanation, because all Chandrasekhar-mass models have severe problems reproducing them. Recently, it has been proposed that violent mergers of two white dwarfs of 0.9 M&sun; could lead to subluminous SNe Ia events that resemble 1991bg-like SNe Ia.  Aims: Here we investigate whether this scenario still works for mergers of two white dwarfs with a mass ratio below one. We aim to determine the range of mass ratios for which a detonation still forms during the merger, as only those events will lead to an SN Ia. This range is an important ingredient for population synthesis and one decisive point for judging the viability of the scenario. In addition, we perform a resolution study of one of the models. Finally we discuss the connection between violent white dwarf mergers with a primary mass of 0.9 M&sun; and 1991bg-like SNe Ia.  Methods: The latest version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Gadget3 was used to evolve binary systems with different mass ratios until they merge. We analyzed the result and looked for hot spots in which detonations can form.  Results: We show that mergers of two white dwarfs with a primary white dwarf mass of ≈ 0.9 M&sun; and a mass ratio more than about 0.8 robustly reach the conditions we require for igniting a detonation and thus produce thermonuclear explosions during the merger itself. We also find that, while our simulations do not yet completely resolve the hot spots, increasing the resolution leads to conditions that are even more likely to ignite detonations. Additionally, we compare the abundance structure of the ejecta of the thermonuclear explosion of two merged white dwarfs with data inferred from observations of a 1991bg-like SN Ia (SN 2005bl). The abundance distributions of intermediate mass and iron group elements in velocity space agree qualitatively, and our model reproduces the lack of material at high velocities inferred from the observations.  Conclusions: The violent merger scenario constitutes a robust possibility for two merging white dwarfs to produce a thermonuclear explosion. Mergers with a primary white dwarf mass of ≈ 0.9 M&sun; are very promising candidates for explaining subluminous SNe Ia. This would imply that subluminous SNe Ia form a distinct class of objects, which are not produced in the standard single white dwarf scenario for SNe Ia, but instead arise from a different progenitor channel and explosion mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Context. Binary population synthesis (BPS) modelling is a very effective tool to study the evolution and properties of various types of close binary systems. The uncertainty in the parameters of the model and their effect on a population can be tested in a statistical way, which then leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying (sometimes poorly understood) physical processes involved. Several BPS codes exist that have been developed with different philosophies and aims. Although BPS has been very successful for studies of many populations of binary stars, in the particular case of the study of the progenitors of supernovae Type Ia, the predicted rates and ZAMS progenitors vary substantially between different BPS codes.  Aims: To understand the predictive power of BPS codes, we study the similarities and differences in the predictions of four different BPS codes for low- and intermediate-mass binaries. We investigate the differences in the characteristics of the predicted populations, and whether they are caused by different assumptions made in the BPS codes or by numerical effects, e.g. a lack of accuracy in BPS codes.  Methods: We compare a large number of evolutionary sequences for binary stars, starting with the same initial conditions following the evolution until the first (and when applicable, the second) white dwarf (WD) is formed. To simplify the complex problem of comparing BPS codes that are based on many (often different) assumptions, we equalise the assumptions as much as possible to examine the inherent differences of the four BPS codes.  Results: We find that the simulated populations are similar between the codes. Regarding the population of binaries with one WD, there is very good agreement between the physical characteristics, the evolutionary channels that lead to the birth of these systems, and their birthrates. Regarding the double WD population, there is a good agreement on which evolutionary channels exist to create double WDs and a rough agreement on the characteristics of the double WD population. Regarding which progenitor systems lead to a single and double WD system and which systems do not, the four codes agree well. Most importantly, we find that for these two populations, the differences in the predictions from the four codes are not due to numerical differences, but because of different inherent assumptions. We identify critical assumptions for BPS studies that need to be studied in more detail.  Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remain mysterious despite their central importance in cosmology and their rapidly increasing discovery rate. The progenitors of SNe Ia can be probed by the delay time between progenitor birth and explosion as SNe Ia. The explosions and progenitors of SNe Ia can be probed by MeV nuclear gamma rays emitted in the decays of radioactive nickel and cobalt into iron. We compare the cosmic star formation and SN Ia rates, finding that their different redshift evolution requires a large fraction of SNe Ia to have large delay times. A delay-time distribution of the form t -alpha with alpha = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.3 provides a good fit, implying that 50% of SNe Ia explode more than ~1 Gyr after progenitor birth. The extrapolation of the cosmic SN Ia rate to z = 0 agrees with the rate we deduce from catalogs of local SNe Ia. We investigate prospects for gamma-ray telescopes to exploit the facts that escaping gamma rays directly reveal the power source of SNe Ia and uniquely provide tomography of the expanding ejecta. We find large improvements relative to earlier studies by Gehrels et al. in 1987 and Timmes & Woosley in 1997 due to larger and more certain SN Ia rates and advances in gamma-ray detectors. The proposed Advanced Compton Telescope, with a narrow-line sensitivity ~60 times better than that of current satellites, would, on an annual basis, detect up to ~100 SNe Ia (3sigma) and provide revolutionary model discrimination for SNe Ia within 20 Mpc, with gamma-ray light curves measured with ~10sigma significance daily for ~100 days. Even more modest improvements in detector sensitivity would open a new and invaluable astronomy with frequent SN Ia gamma-ray detections.},

@article{Toonen:2014,
	Abstract = {White dwarfs (WDs) can increase their mass by accretion from companion stars, provided the mass-accretion rate is high enough to avoid nova eruptions. The accretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming constant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are influenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales. We investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs systems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter space of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore, we find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to a rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The changes in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar populations with ages of a few Gyr. Thus, mass-transfer variability gives rise to a new formation channel of SNIa events that can significantly contribute to the SNIa rate. Mass-transfer variability is also likely to affect other binary populations through enhanced WD growth. For example, it may explain why WDs in cataclysmic variables are observed to be more massive than single WDs, on average.},

	Abstract = {We perform a strong lensing analysis of the merging galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (M0416; z = 0.42) in recent CLASH/HST observations. We identify 70 new multiple images and candidates of 23 background sources in the range 0.7 <~ z phot <~ 6.14 including two probable high-redshift dropouts, revealing a highly elongated lens with axis ratio sime5:1, and a major axis of ~100'' (zs ~ 2). Compared to other well-studied clusters, M0416 shows an enhanced lensing efficiency. Although the critical area is not particularly large (sime 0.6 squ'; zs ~ 2), the number of multiple images, per critical area, is anomalously high. We calculate that the observed elongation boosts the number of multiple images, per critical area, by a factor of ~2.5 ×, due to the increased ratio of the caustic area relative to the critical area. Additionally, we find that the observed separation between the two main mass components enlarges the critical area by a factor of ~2. These geometrical effects can account for the high number (density) of multiple images observed. We find in numerical simulations that only ~4% of the clusters (with M vir >= 6 × 1014 h -1 M &sun;) exhibit critical curves as elongated as in M0416.},

	Abstract = {We use a joint optical/X-ray analysis to constrain the geometry and history of the ongoing merging event in the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 (z=0.397). Our investigation of cluster substructure rests primarily on a strong and weak lensing mass reconstruction based on the deep, high-resolution images obtained for the HFF initiative. To reveal the system's dynamics, we complement this lensing analysis with a study of the intra-cluster gas using Chandra data, and a 3D model of the distribution and motions of cluster galaxies derived from >100 spectroscopic redshifts. The multi-scale grid model obtained from our combined weak and strong lensing analysis extends high-precision mass reconstruction for the cluster core to cluster-centric distances of almost 1 Mpc. Our analysis detects the two well known mass concentrations near the centre of the field. A pronounced offset between collisional and collisionless matter is only observed for the SW cluster component, while excellent alignment is found for the NE cluster. Both the lensing analysis and the distribution of cluster light strongly suggest the presence of a third massive structure, almost 2arcmin SW of the cluster centre. Since no X-ray emission is detected in this region, we conclude that this structure is non-virialised and speculate that it might be part of a large-scale filament that is almost aligned with our line of sight. Combining all evidence from the distribution of dark and luminous matter, we propose two alternative scenarios for the trajectories of the components of MACSJ0416.1-2403 (one pre-, the other post-collision), a merger that features a significant impact parameter and is proceeding along an axis that is highly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky.},

	Abstract = {We present a free form mass reconstruction of the massive lensing cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 using the latest Hubble Frontier Fields data. Our model independent method finds that the extended lensing pattern is generated by two elongated, closely projected clusters of similar mass. Our lens model identifies new lensed images with which we improve the accuracy of the dark matter distribution. We find that the bimodal mass distribution is nearly coincident with the bimodal X-ray emission, but with the two dark matter peaks lying closer together than the centroids of the X-ray emisison. We show this can be achieved if the collision has occurred close to the plane and such that the cores are deflected around each other. The projected mass profiles of both clusters are well constrained because of the many interior lensed images, leading to surprisingly flat mass profiles of both components in the region 15-100 kpc. We discuss the extent to which this may be generated by tidal forces in our dynamical model which are large during an encounter of this type as the cores "graze" each other. The relative velocity between the two cores is estimated to be about 1200 km/s and mostly along the line of sight so that our model is consistent with the relative redshift difference between the two cD galaxies (dz = 0.04).},

	Abstract = {We predict the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), assuming that they trace the cosmic star formation history. We find that a fraction >~50% of all GRBs on the sky originate at a redshift z>~5, even though the fraction of the total stellar mass formed by z~5 is only ~15%. These two fractions are significantly different, because they involve different cosmological factors when integrating the star formation rate over redshift. Hence, deep observations of transient events, such as GRB afterglows or supernovae, provide an ideal strategy for probing the high-redshift universe. We caution, however, that existing or planned flux-limited instruments are likely to detect somewhat smaller fractions of high-redshift bursts. For example, we estimate that the fraction of all bursts with redshifts z>~5 is ~10% in the case of the BATSE instrument and ~25% in the case of Swift. We also show that the intrinsic distribution of GRB durations is bimodal but significantly narrower and shifted toward shorter durations than the observed distribution.},

@article{Madau:1996,
	Abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z>~2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3<~z<~3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2<~z<~4.5. While none of the ~60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0<~z<~1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6<~z<~3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at <z>=2.75 of ~=3.6x10^-4 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3 (for q_0=0.5 and H_0=50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z~=1. At <z>=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is ~=3 times lower than the <z>=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

@article{Nobili:2005,
	Abstract = {We present a novel technique for fitting restframe I-band light curves on a data set of 42 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the result of the fit, we construct a Hubble diagram with 26 SNe from the subset at 0.01< z<0.1. Adding two SNe at z˜0.5 yields results consistent with a flat Lambda-dominated ``concordance universe'' (Omega_M, Omega_Lambda) = (0.25, 0.75). For one of these, SN 2000fr, new near infrared data are presented. The high redshift supernova NIR data are also used to test for systematic effects in the use of SNe Ia as distance estimators. A flat, Lambda=0, universe where the faintness of supernovae at z˜0.5 is due to grey dust homogeneously distributed in the intergalactic medium is disfavoured based on the high-z Hubble diagram using this small data-set. However, the uncertainties are large and no firm conclusion may be drawn. We explore the possibility of setting limits on intergalactic dust based on B-I and B-V colour measurements, and conclude that about 20 well measured SNe are needed to give statistically significant results. We also show that the high redshift restframe I-band data points are better fit by light curve templates that show a prominent second peak, suggesting that they are not intrinsically underluminous.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Nearby Supernova Factory data set with spectrophotometry at sufficiently late phases to estimate the ejected mass using the bolometric light curve. We measure 56Ni masses from the peak bolometric luminosity, then compare the luminosity in the 56Co-decay tail to the expected rate of radioactive energy release from ejecta of a given mass. We infer the ejected mass in a Bayesian context using a semi-analytic model of the ejecta, incorporating constraints from contemporary numerical models as priors on the density structure and distribution of 56Ni throughout the ejecta. We find a strong correlation between ejected mass and light-curve decline rate, and consequently 56Ni mass, with ejected masses in our data ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 M&sun;. Most fast-declining (SALT2 x1 < -1) normal SNe Ia have significantly sub-Chandrasekhar ejected masses in our fiducial analysis.},

@article{Silverman:2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyse optical photometry and spectra of the extremely luminous and slowly evolving Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2009dc, and offer evidence that it is a super-Chandrasekhar mass (SC) SN Ia and thus has a SC white dwarf (WD) progenitor. Optical spectra of SN 2007if, a similar object, are also shown. SN 2009dc had one of the most slowly evolving light curves ever observed for a SN Ia, with a rise time of ˜23 d and Deltam15(B) = 0.72 mag. We calculate a lower limit to the peak bolometric luminosity of ˜2.4 × 1043 erg s-1, though the actual value is likely almost 40 per cent larger. Optical spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if obtained near maximum brightness exhibit strong C II features (indicative of a significant amount of unburned material), and the post-maximum spectra are dominated by iron-group elements (IGEs). All of our spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if also show low expansion velocities. However, we see no strong evidence in SN 2009dc for a velocity `plateau' near maximum light like the one seen in SN 2007if. The high luminosity and low expansion velocities of SN 2009dc lead us to derive a possible WD progenitor mass of more than 2 M&sun; and a 56Ni mass of about 1.4-1.7 M&sun;. We propose that the host galaxy of SN 2009dc underwent a gravitational interaction with a neighbouring galaxy in the relatively recent past. This may have led to a sudden burst of star formation which could have produced the SC WD progenitor of SN 2009dc and likely turned the neighbouring galaxy into a `post-starburst galaxy'. No published model seems to match the extreme values observed in SN 2009dc, but simulations do show that such massive progenitors can exist (likely as a result of the merger of two WDs) and can possibly explode as SC SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {The presence of a well-defined and narrow dust lane in an edge-on spiral galaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, in which gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. Using a sample of galaxies out to z ~ 1 extracted from the COSMOS survey, we identify the fraction of massive (L* V ) disks that display a dust lane. Our goal is to explore the evolution in the stability of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmic timescale. We check the reliability of our morphological classifications against changes in rest-frame wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with (artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the fraction of L* V disks with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with the local fraction (≈80%) out to z ~ 0.7. At z = 0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightly lower. A somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentatively supports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficiently destroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. A small subsample of higher redshift COSMOS galaxies display low internal reddening (E[B - V]), as well as a low incidence of dust lanes. These may be disks in which the growth of the dusty ISM disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. We note that at z = 0.8, the most massive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. A small contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massive population may be responsible. The fact that the fraction of galaxies with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with little or no evolution implies that models to explain the spectral energy distribution or the host galaxy dust extinction of supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshift spirals. It also suggests that dust lanes are long-lived phenomena or can be reformed over very short timescales.},

	Abstract = {A large sample of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1.4 <= z spec <= 3.7, with complementary imaging in the near- and mid-IR from the ground and from the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope, is used to infer the average star formation histories (SFHs) of typical galaxies from z ~ 2 to 7. For a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5 <= z spec < 2.6, we perform a detailed comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that are 5-10 times lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may not be accurate for typical galaxies at z >~ 2. The SFRs of z ~ 2-3 galaxies are directly proportional to their stellar masses (M *), with unity slope---a result that is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint ({\cal R}>25.5) galaxies---for M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt >~ 5 × 108 M &sun; and SFRs >~ 2 M &sun; yr-1. We interpret this result in the context of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the SFR-M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt relation. The average specific SFRs at z ~ 2-3 are remarkably similar within a factor of two to those measured at z >~ 4, implying that the average SFH is one where SFRs increase with time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (1) a substantial fraction of UV-bright z ~ 2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z >~ 4; and (2) gas masses must increase with time from z = 2 to 7, over which time the net cold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific SFR and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation---is ~2-3 times larger than the SFR. However, if we evolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to host L* galaxies at z ~ 2, then we find that <~ 10% of the baryons accreted onto typical halos at z >~ 4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These results highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early cosmic times when galaxies were first assembling. Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {On 2012 May 17.2 UT, only 1.5 $\pm$ 0.2 days after explosion, we discovered SN 2012cg, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 4424 (d ≈ 15 Mpc). As a result of the newly modified strategy employed by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search, a sequence of filtered images was obtained starting 161 s after discovery. Utilizing recent models describing the interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta with a companion star, we rule out a ~1 M &sun; companion for half of all viewing angles and a red-giant companion for nearly all orientations. SN 2012cg reached a B-band maximum of 12.09 $\pm$ 0.02 mag on 2012 June 2.0 and took ~17.3 days from explosion to reach this, typical for SNe Ia. Our pre-maximum-brightness photometry shows a narrower-than-average B-band light curve for SN 2012cg, though slightly overluminous at maximum brightness and with normal color evolution (including some of the earliest SN Ia filtered photometry ever obtained). Spectral fits to SN 2012cg reveal ions typically found in SNe Ia at early times, with expansion velocities gsim14,000 km s-1 at 2.5 days past explosion. Absorption from C II is detected early, as well as high-velocity components of both Si II lambda6355 and Ca II. Our last spectrum (13.5 days past explosion) resembles that of the somewhat peculiar SN Ia 1999aa. This suggests that SN 2012cg will have a slower-than-average declining light curve, which may be surprising given the faster-than-average rising light curve.},

@article{Nielsen:2013,
	Abstract = {Context. The progenitors of Type Ia supernovae are usually assumed to be either a single white dwarf accreting from a non-degenerate companion (the single-degenerate channel) or the result of two merging white dwarfs (the double degenerate channel). However, no consensus currently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether the observed Type Ia supernovae rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a double degenerate progenitor, a single-degenerate progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a prolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter on the surface of the white dwarf. An argument against the single-degenerate channel as a significant producer of Type Ia supernovae has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical galaxies. Aims: We wish to determine whether it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray emission from a nuclear-burning white dwarf in an accreting single-degenerate binary system. In the case of obscured systems we wish to determine their general observational characteristics. Methods: We examine the emergent X-ray emission from a canonical supersoft X-ray system surrounded by a spherically symmetric configuration of material, assuming a black-body spectrum with Tbb = 50 eV and L = 1038 erg s-1. The circumbinary material is assumed to be of solar chemical abundances, and we leave the mechanism behind the mass-loss into the circumbinary region unspecified. Results: We find that relatively low circumstellar mass-loss rates, M = 10-9-10-8 M&sun; yr-1, at binary separations of ~1 AU or less, will cause significant attenuation of the X-rays from the supersoft X-ray source. These circumstellar mass-loss rates are sufficient to make a canonical supersoft X-ray source in typical external galaxies unobservable in Chandra. Conclusions: If steadily accreting, nuclear-burning white dwarfs are canonical supersoft X-ray sources our analysis suggests that they can be obscured by relatively modest circumbinary mass-loss rates. This may explain the discrepancy of supersoft sources relative to the Type Ia supernova rate inferred from observations if the single-degenerate progenitor scenario contributes significantly to the Type Ia supernova rate. Recycled emissions from obscured systems may be visible in wavebands other than X-rays. It may also explain the lack of observed supersoft sources in symbiotic binary systems.},

	Abstract = {We argue that the multiple shells of circumstellar material (CSM) and the supernovae (SNe) ejecta interaction with the CSM starting 59 d after the explosion of the Type Ia SN PTF 11kx are best described by a violent prompt merger. In this prompt merger scenario, the common envelope (CE) phase is terminated by a merger of a white dwarf (WD) companion with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch star. In most cases, the WD is disrupted and accreted on to the more massive core. However, in the rare cases, where the merger takes place when the WD is denser than the core, the core will be disrupted and accreted on to the cooler WD. In such cases, the explosion might occur with no appreciable delay, i.e. months to years after the termination of the CE phase. This, we propose, might be the evolutionary route that could lead to the explosion of PTF 11kx. This scenario can account for the very massive CSM within ˜1000 au of the exploding PTF 11kx star, for the presence of hydrogen, and for the presence of shells in the CSM.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M stellar) between redshift 4 and 6 to assess the reported "constant" sSFR at z > 2. We derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for a large sample of 750 z ~ 4-6 galaxies in the GOODS-S field by fitting stellar population models to their spectral energy distributions. Dust extinction is derived from the observed UV colors. We evaluate different star formation histories (SFHs, constant and rising with time) and the impact of optical emission lines. The SFR and M stellar values are insensitive to whether the SFH is constant or rising. The derived sSFR is very similar (within 0.1 dex) in two M stellar bins centered at 1 and 5 × 109 M &sun;. The effect of emission lines was, however, quite pronounced. Assuming no contribution from emission lines, the sSFR for galaxies at 5 × 109 M &sun; evolves weakly at z > 2 (sSFR(z)vprop(1 + z)0.6 $\pm$ 0.1), consistent with previous results. When emission lines are included in the rest-frame optical bands, consistent with the observed Infrared Array Camera [3.6] and [4.5] fluxes, the sSFR shows higher values at high redshift following sSFR(z)vprop(1 + z)1.0 $\pm$ 0.1, i.e., the best-fit evolution shows a sSFR ~2.3 × higher at z ~ 6 than at z ~ 2. This is, however, a substantially weaker trend than that found at z < 2 and even than that expected from current models for z > 2 (sSFR(z)vprop(1 + z)2.5). Even accounting for emission lines, the observed sSFR(z) trends at z > 2 are still in tension with theoretical expectations.},

	Abstract = {The cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) has been observationally investigated out to redshift z ~= 10. However, most of the theoretical models for galaxy formation underpredict the CSFRD at z >~ 1. Since the theoretical models reproduce the observed luminosity functions (LFs), luminosity densities (LDs), and stellar mass density at each redshift, this inconsistency does not simply imply that theoretical models should incorporate some missing unknown physical processes in galaxy formation. Here, we examine the cause of this inconsistency at UV wavelengths by using a mock catalog of galaxies generated by a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We find that this inconsistency is due to two observational uncertainties: the dust obscuration correction and the conversion from UV luminosity to star formation rate (SFR). The methods for correction of obscuration and SFR conversion used in observational studies result in the overestimation of the CSFRD by ~0.1-0.3 dex and ~0.1-0.2 dex, respectively, compared to the results obtained directly from our mock catalog. We present new empirical calibrations for dust attenuation and conversion from observed UV LFs and LDs into the CSFRD.},

	Abstract = {Using a population number synthesis code with detailed binary evolution, we calculate the distribution of the number of Type Ia supernovae as a function of time after starburst. This is done for both main progenitor scenarios (single degenerate and double degenerate), but also with various evolutionary assumptions (such as mass transfer efficiency, angular momentum loss, and common envelope description). The comparison of these theoretically predicted delay time distributions with observations in elliptical galaxies then allows us to constrain the evolutionary scenarios and parameters. From the morphological shape of the distributions, we conclude that all supernovae Ia cannot be produced through the single degenerate scenario alone, with the best match being obtained when both scenarios contribute. Within the double degenerate scenario, most systems go through a phase of quasi-conservative, stable Roche lobe overflow. We propose stellar rotation as a possible solution for the underestimation of the absolute numbers of events predicted by many theoretical population synthesis studies. A brief comparison with these other studies is made, showing good correspondence under the nontrivial condition of equivalent assumptions. We also investigate the influence of different supernova Ia progenitors and evolutionary parameters on the theoretical distribution of the iron abundance of G-type dwarfs in the Galactic disk. These stars are good indicators of the entire chemical history of the Galaxy, and their predicted metallicity distribution can also be compared to the observed ones. This again limits the number of acceptable combinations of assumptions. Supporting previous results, the best correspondence is found in the case where both the single and double degenerate scenario contribute.},

	Abstract = {We present a comparison of two methods for cosmological parameter inference from Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) light curves fitted with the SALT-II technique, in which we treat the statistical errors but not the systematic errors. The standard chi2 methodology and the recently proposed SNeIa Bayesian hierarchical method (SNBHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-yr data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the low-redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope, assuming a concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. For both methods, we find that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae light curves, suffer from small biases. The magnitude of the biases is similar in both cases, with the SNBHM yielding slightly more accurate results for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the biases in the recovered matter density Omegam,0 are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realization of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a ˜2sigma discrepancy in the estimated value of Omegam,0 between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge.},

	Abstract = {We compute the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) rates in typical elliptical galaxies by varying the progenitor models for SNeIa. To do that a formalism which takes into account the delay distribution function of the explosion times and a given star formation history is adopted. Then the chemical evolution for ellipticals with baryonic initial masses 1010, 1011 and 1012 M&sun; is computed, and the mass of Fe produced by each galaxy is precisely estimated. We also compute the expected Fe mass ejected by ellipticals in typical galaxy clusters (e.g. Coma and Virgo), under different assumptions about SNIa progenitors. As a last step, we compute the cosmic SNIa rate in a unitary volume of the Universe by adopting several cosmic star formation rates and compare it with the available and recent observational data. Unfortunately, no firm conclusions can be derived only from the cosmic SNIa rate, neither on SNIa progenitors nor on the cosmic star formation rate. Finally, by analysing all our results together, and by taking into account previous chemical evolution results, we try to constrain the best Type Ia progenitor model. We conclude that the best progenitor models for SNeIa are still the single degenerate model, the double degenerate wide model and the empirical bimodal model. All these models require the existence of prompt SNeIa, exploding in the first 100 Myr since the beginning of star formation, although their fraction should not exceed 15-20 per cent in order to fit chemical abundances in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Objects of known brightness, like type Ia supernovae (SNIa), can be used to measure distances. If a massive object warps spacetime to form multiple images of a background SNIa, a direct test of cosmic expansion is also possible. However, these lensing events must first be distinguished from other rare phenomena. Recently, a supernova was found to shine much brighter than normal for its distance, which resulted in a debate: Was it a new type of superluminous supernova or a normal SNIa magnified by a hidden gravitational lens? Here, we report that a spectrum obtained after the supernova faded away shows the presence of a foreground galaxy---the first found to strongly magnify a SNIa. We discuss how more lensed SNIa can be found than previously predicted.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the properties of Population III (Pop III) stars is prerequisite to elucidating the nature of primeval galaxies, the chemical enrichment and reionization of the early intergalactic medium, and the origin of supermassive black holes. While the primordial initial mass function (IMF) remains unknown, recent evidence from numerical simulations and stellar archaeology suggests that some Pop III stars may have had lower masses than previously thought, 15-50 M &sun; in addition to 50-500 M &sun;. The detection of Pop III supernovae (SNe) by JWST, WFIRST, or the TMT could directly probe the primordial IMF for the first time. We present numerical simulations of 15-40 M &sun; Pop III core-collapse SNe performed with the Los Alamos radiation hydrodynamics code RAGE. We find that they will be visible in the earliest galaxies out to z ~ 10-15, tracing their star formation rates and in some cases revealing their positions on the sky. Since the central engines of Pop III and solar-metallicity core-collapse SNe are quite similar, future detection of any Type II SNe by next-generation NIR instruments will in general be limited to this epoch.},

@article{Hernan-Caballero:2012,
	Abstract = {Obtaining accurate redshifts from mid-infrared (MIR) low-resolution (R ˜ 100) spectroscopy is challenging because the wavelength resolution is too low to detect narrow lines in most cases. Yet, the number of degrees of freedom and diversity of spectral features are too high for regular spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques to be convenient. Here we present a new SED-fitting-based routine for redshift determination that is optimized for MIR low-resolution spectroscopy. Its flexible template scaling increases the sensitivity to slope changes and small-scale features in the spectrum, while a new selection algorithm called maximum combined pseudo-likelihood (MCPL) provides increased accuracy and a lower number of outliers compared to the standard maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. Unlike ML approach, the MCPL approach searches for local (instead of absolute) maxima of a 'pseudo-likelihood' (PL) function, and combines results obtained for all the templates in the library to weed out spurious redshift solutions. The capabilities of the MCPL approach are demonstrated by comparing its redshift estimates to those of the regular ML approach and to the optical spectroscopic redshifts of a sample of 491 Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph spectra from extragalactic sources at 0 < z < 3.7. The MCPL approach achieves a redshift accuracy Delta(z)/(1 + z) < 0.005 for 78 per cent of the galaxies in the sample compared to 68 per cent for the ML approach. The rate of outliers [Delta(z)/(1 + z) > 0.02] is 14 per cent for the MCPL approach and 22 per cent for the ML approach. chi2 values for ML solutions are found to correlate with the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra, but not with redshift accuracy. By contrast, the peak value of the normalized combined PL (gamma) is found to provide a good indication on the reliability of the MCPL solution for individual sources. The accuracy and reliability of the redshifts depend strongly on the MIR SED. Sources with significant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission obtain much better results compared to sources dominated by active galactic nucleus continua. Nevertheless, for a given gamma the frequency of accurate solutions and outliers is largely independent of their SED type. This reliability indicator for MCPL solutions allows to select subsamples with highly reliable redshifts. In particular, a gamma > 0.15 threshold retains 79 per cent of the sources with Delta(z)/(1 + z) < 0.005 while reducing the outlier rate to 3.8 per cent.},

@article{Rodney:2014,
	Abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg2 with ~900 HST orbits spread across five fields over three years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SNe) of all types, out to z ~ 2.5. We classify ~24 of these as Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six SNe). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SNe that exploded when the universe was only ~3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SNe Ia that explode promptly after formation (<500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this prompt SN Ia fraction is f_{P}\,{=}\,0.53^{\ \,\, +/- 0.09}_{stat0.10} {}^{\ \, +/- 0.10}_{sys 0.26}, consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t --1 power law for all times t > 40 Myr. However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we find a low rate of SNe Ia at z > 1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only 20% of all SN Ia explosions---though further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the roughly 160 arcmin2 ACS-GOODS region surrounding the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N). We have identified 892 galaxies or stars with z'<24, R<24.5, or B<25 in the region. The spectra were obtained with either the DEIMOS or LRIS spectrographs on the Keck 10 m telescopes. The results are compared with photometric redshift estimates and with redshifts from the literature, as well as with the redshifts of a parallel effort led by a group at Keck. Our sample, when combined with the literature data, provides identifications for 1324 sources. We use our results to determine the redshift distributions with magnitude, to analyze the rest-frame color distributions with redshift and spectral type, and to investigate the dependence of the X-ray galaxy properties on the local galaxy density in the redshift interval z=0-1.5. We find the rather surprising result that the galaxy X-ray properties are not strongly dependent on the local galaxy density for galaxies in the same luminosity range.},

	Abstract = {We present deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, along with 16, 24, 70, and 850 mum photometry, for 22 galaxies located in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field. The sample spans a redshift range of 0.6 lsim z lsim 2.6, 24 mum flux densities between ~0.2 and 1.2 mJy, and consists of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), X-ray or optically selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and optically faint (zAB > 25 mag) sources. We find that infrared (IR; 8-1000 mum) luminosities derived by fitting local spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with 24 mum photometry alone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and longer wavelength photometric data are used for galaxies having z lsim 1.4 and 24 mum-derived IR luminosities typically lsim3 × 1012 L sun. However, for galaxies in the redshift range between 1.4 lsim z lsim 2.6, typically having 24-mum-derived IR luminosities gsim3 × 1012 L sun, IR luminosities are overestimated by an average factor of ~5 when SED fitting with 24 mum photometry alone. This result arises partly due to the fact that high-redshift galaxies exhibit aromatic feature equivalent widths that are large compared to local galaxies of similar luminosities. Using improved estimates for the IR luminosities of these sources, we investigate whether their infrared emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based on extinction-corrected UV star formation rates (SFRs), possibly suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN. Through a spectral decomposition of mid-infrared spectroscopic data, we are able to isolate the fraction of IR luminosity arising from an AGN as opposed to star formation activity. This fraction is only able to account for ~30% of the total IR luminosity among the entire sample and ~35% of the "excess" IR emission among these sources, on average, suggesting that AGNs are not the dominant cause of the inferred "mid-infrared excesses" in these systems. Of the sources identified as having mid-infrared excesses, half are accounted for by using proper bolometric corrections while half show the presence of obscured AGNs. This implies sky and space densities for Compton-thick AGNs of ~1600 deg-2 and ~1.3 × 10-4 Mpc-3, respectively. We also note that IR luminosities derived from SED fitting the mid-infrared and 70 mum broadband photometry agree within ~50% to those values estimated using the additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and submillimeter data. An inspection of the far-infrared (FIR)-radio correlation shows no evidence for evolution over this redshift range. However, we find that the SMGs have IR/radio ratios which are a factor of ~3 lower, on average, than what is measured for star-forming galaxies in the local universe.},

@article{van-Dokkum:2009,
	Abstract = {Deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distant galaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding of the early Universe. As the vast majority of K- or IRAC-selected galaxies are too faint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almost exclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to the broadband photometry. The best-achieved accuracy of these redshifts, Dz/(1+z)≳0.06Deltaz/(1 + z) ≳ 0.06 at z>1.5, is sufficient for determining the broad characteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accurate rest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density. We have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the NEWFIRM camera on the Kitt Peak 4-m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts in the range 1.5≲z≲3.5. The survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, which provide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 mum for all objects in the 27.6'×27.6' NEWFIRM field. In this first paper, we illustrate the technique by showing medium-band NEWFIRM photometry of several galaxies at 1.7<z<2.7 from the recent near-infrared spectroscopic sample of Kriek et al.. The filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted Balmer break in these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. The full survey will provide similar data for ˜8000 faint K-selected galaxies at z>1.5 in the COSMOS and AEGIS fields. The filter set also enables efficient selection of exotic objects such as high-redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emission lines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late T and candidate Y dwarfs could be identified using only two of the filters.},

@article{Kriek:2010,
	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key ingredient of many galaxy evolution studies. Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different implementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties. Post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are thought to be most prominently visible during this phase. Here, we use post-starburst galaxies in the NEWFIRM medium-band survey to assess different SPS models. The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and well-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7 <~ z <~ 2.0, from which we construct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the range 1200-40000 {\AA}. The SED is well fit by the Bruzual & Charlot SPS models, while the Maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical and near-infrared parts of the SED simultaneously. When the fitting is restricted to lambda < 6000 {\AA}, the Maraston models overpredict the near-infrared luminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to TP-AGB stars. Using the flexible SPS models by Conroy et al. and assuming solar metallicity, we find that the contribution of TP-AGB stars to the integrated SED is a factor of ~3 lower than predicted by the latest Padova TP-AGB models. Whether this is due to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust obscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed. Altogether, our data demand a low contribution from TP-AGB stars to the SED of post-starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Supernovae are important probes of the properties of stars at high redshifts because they can be detected at early epochs and their masses can be inferred from their light curves. Finding the first cosmic explosions in the universe will only be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes. But strong gravitational lensing by massive clusters, like those in the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH), could reveal such events now by magnifying their flux by factors of 10 or more. We find that CLASH will likely discover at least 2 - 3 core-collapse supernovae at 5 < z < 12 and perhaps as many as ten. Future surveys of cluster lenses similar in scope to CLASH by the James Webb Space Telescope might find hundreds of these events out to z ~ 15 - 17. Besides revealing the masses of early stars, these ancient supernovae will also constrain cosmic star formation rates in the era of first galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the diversity of V-band light-curves of hydrogen-rich type II supernovae. Analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, several magnitude measurements are defined, together with decline rates at different epochs, and time durations of different phases. It is found that magnitudes measured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than those measured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have faster declining light-curves at all epochs. We find a relation between the decline rate during the "plateau" phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of 0.56 mag, offering the prospect of using type II supernovae as purely photometric distance indicators. Our analysis suggests that the type II population spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have flat light-curves during the "plateau" stage, through to the brightest events which decline much faster. A large range in optically thick phase durations is observed, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch of explosion. During the radioactive tails, we find many supernovae with faster declining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactive emission, implying low mass ejecta. It is suggested that the main driver of light-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained before explosion. Finally, a new classification scheme is introduced where hydrogen-rich events are typed as simply "SN II" with an "s 2" value giving the decline rate during the "plateau" phase, indicating its morphological type.  Based on observations obtained with the du-Pont and Swope telescopes at LCO, and the Steward Observatory's CTIO60, SO90 and CTIO36 telescopes.},

	Abstract = {Using three magnified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) detected behind CLASH (Cluster Lensing and Supernovae with Hubble) clusters, we perform a first pilot study to see whether standardizable candles can be used to calibrate cluster mass maps created from strong lensing observations. Such calibrations will be crucial when next-generation Hubble Space Telescope cluster surveys (e.g. Frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn, form the basis for the exploration of the high-redshift Universe. We classify SNe using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two of the three to be clearly of Type Ia and the third probable. The SNe exhibit significant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at ˜5sigma significance (SN-L2). We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine-tuning of parameters, finding a mean amplification difference between SNe and the cluster lensing models of 0.09 $\pm$ 0.09stat $\pm$ 0.05sys mag. This impressive agreement suggests no tension between cluster mass models and high-redshift-standardized SNe Ia. However, the measured statistical dispersion of sigmamu = 0.21 mag appeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statistical uncertainties (0.14). Further work with the SN and cluster lensing models, post-unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to sigmamu = 0.12. An explicit choice should thus be made as to whether SNe are used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. As the lensed SN samples grow larger, this technique will allow improved constraints on assumptions regarding e.g. the structure of the dark matter halo.},

	Abstract = {We report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) Multi-Cycle Treasury program. These objects, SN CLO12Car (z = 1.28), SN CLN12Did (z = 0.85), and SN CLA11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and A383 (z = 0.187), respectively. Each SN was detected in Hubble Space Telescope optical and infrared images. Based on photometric classification, we find that SNe CLO12Car and CLN12Did are likely to be Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), while the classification of SN CLA11Tib is inconclusive. Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we infer that SN CLO12Car was ~1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is ~0.2 $\pm$ 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted magnification from CLASH strong+weak-lensing maps of the clusters (in magnitude units, 2.5 log10mu): 0.83 $\pm$ 0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 $\pm$ 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 $\pm$ 0.11 mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. Our results herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia (from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution in clusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolute magnifications.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Subaru Deep Field (SDF) Supernova Survey discovered ten Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 1.5 < z < 2.0, determined solely from photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. However, photometric redshifts might be biased, and the SN sample could be contaminated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  Aims: We aim to obtain the first robust redshift measurement and classification of a z > 1.5 SDF SN Ia host galaxy candidate.  Methods: We use the X-shooter (U-to-K-band) spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope to allow the detection of different emission lines in a wide spectral range.  Results: We measure a spectroscopic redshift of 1.54563 $\pm$ 0.00027 of hSDF0705.25, consistent with its photometric redshift of 1.552 $\pm$ 0.018. From the strong emission-line spectrum we rule out AGN activity, thereby confirming the optical transient as a SN. The host galaxy follows the fundamental metallicity relation showing that the properties of this high-redshift SN Ia host galaxy is similar to other field galaxies.  Conclusions: Spectroscopic confirmation of additional SDF SN hosts would be required to confirm the cosmic SN rate evolution measured in the SDF.

	Abstract = {Past analyses of Type Ia supernovae have identified an irreducible scatter of 5%-10% in distance, widely attributed to an intrinsic dispersion in luminosity. Another equally valid source of this scatter is intrinsic dispersion in color. Misidentification of the true source of this scatter can bias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parameter measurements. The size of this bias depends on the magnitude of the intrinsic color dispersion relative to the distribution of colors that correlate with distance. We produce a realistic simulation of a misattribution of intrinsic scatter and find a negative bias in the recovered color-luminosity relation, beta, of Deltabeta ≈ -1.0 (~33%) and a positive bias in the equation of state parameter, w, of Deltaw ≈ +0.04 (~4%). We re-analyze current published datasets with the assumption that the distance scatter is predominantly the result of color. Unlike previous analyses, we find that the data are consistent with a Milky-Way-like reddening law (RV = 3.1) and that a Milky-Way dust model better predicts the asymmetric color-luminosity trends than the conventional luminosity scatter hypothesis. We also determine that accounting for color variation reduces the correlation between various host galaxy properties and Hubble residuals by ~20%.},

	Abstract = {It is thought that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). Two main evolutionary channels are proposed for the WD to reach the critical density required for a thermonuclear explosion: the single degenerate (SD) scenario, in which a CO WD accretes from a non-degenerate companion, and the double degenerate (DD) scenario, in which two CO WDs merge. However, it remains difficult to reproduce the observed SN Ia rate with these two scenarios. With a binary population synthesis code we study the main evolutionary channels that lead to SNe Ia and we calculate the SN Ia rates and the associated delay-time distributions. We find that the DD channel is the dominant formation channel for the longest delay times. The SD channel with helium-rich donors is the dominant channel at the shortest delay times. Our standard model rate is a factor of five lower than the observed rate in galaxy clusters. We investigate the influence of ill-constrained aspects of single- and binary-star evolution and uncertain initial binary distributions on the rate of Type Ia SNe. These distributions, as well as uncertainties in both helium star evolution and common envelope evolution, have the greatest influence on our calculated rates. Inefficient common envelope evolution increases the relative number of SD explosions such that for alphace = 0.2 they dominate the SN Ia rate. Our highest rate is a factor of three less than the galaxy-cluster SN Ia rate, but compatible with the rate determined in a field-galaxy dominated sample. If we assume unlimited accretion onto WDs, to maximize the number of SD explosions, our rate is compatible with the observed galaxy-cluster rate.

	Abstract = {Using a method to discover and classify supernovae (SNe) in galaxy spectra, we find 90 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 10 Type II SNe among the ˜700 000 galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 that have star-formation histories (SFHs) derived with the VErsatile SPectral Analysis code (VESPA). We use the SN Ia sample to measure SN Ia rates per unit stellar mass. We confirm, at the median redshift of the sample, z = 0.1, the inverse dependence on galaxy mass of the SN Ia rate per unit mass, previously reported by Li et al. for a local sample. We further confirm, following Kistler et al., that this relation can be explained by the combination of galaxy `downsizing' and a power-law delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a hypothetical burst of star formation and the subsequent SN Ia explosions) with an index of -1, inherent to the double-degenerate progenitor scenario. We use the method of Maoz et al. to recover the DTD by comparing the number of SNe Ia hosted by each galaxy in our sample with the VESPA-derived SFH of the stellar population within the spectral aperture. In this galaxy sample, which is dominated by old and massive galaxies, we recover a `delayed' component to the DTD of 4.5 $\pm$ 0.6 (statistical){_{-0.5}^+0.3} (systematic) × 10- 14 SNe M&sun;- 1 yr- 1 for delays in the range >2.4 Gyr. The mass-normalized SN Ia rate, averaged over all masses and redshifts in our galaxy sample, is R_{Ia,M}(z=0.1) = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.01 (statistical) $\pm$ 0.01 (systematic) SNuM, and the volumetric rate is RIa, V(z = 0.1) = 0.247_{-0.026}^{+0.029} (statistical) _{-0.031}^{+0.016} (systematic) × 10- 4 SNe yr- 1 Mpc- 3. This rate is consistent with the rates and rate evolution from other recent SN Ia surveys, which together also indicate a ˜t-1 DTD.},

@article{Zheng:2012,
	Abstract = {Re-ionization of the intergalactic medium occurred in the early Universe at redshift z~6-11, following the formation of the first generation of stars. Those young galaxies (where the bulk of stars formed) at a cosmic age of less than about 500 million years (z<~10) remain largely unexplored because they are at or beyond the sensitivity limits of existing large telescopes. Understanding the properties of these galaxies is critical to identifying the source of the radiation that re-ionized the intergalactic medium. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters allows the detection of high-redshift galaxies fainter than what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. Here we report multiband observations of the cluster MACS J1149+2223 that have revealed (with high probability) a gravitationally magnified galaxy from the early Universe, at a redshift of z = 9.6+/-0.2 (that is, a cosmic age of 490+/-15 million years, or 3.6 per cent of the age of the Universe). We estimate that it formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang (at the 95 per cent confidence level), implying a formation redshift of <~14. Given the small sky area that our observations cover, faint galaxies seem to be abundant at such a young cosmic age, suggesting that they may be the dominant source for the early re-ionization of the intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {We precisely constrain the inner mass profile of A2261 (z = 0.225) for the first time and determine that this cluster is not "overconcentrated" as found previously, implying a formation time in agreement with LambdaCDM expectations. These results are based on multiple strong-lensing analyses of new 16-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging obtained as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. Combining this with revised weak-lensing analyses of Subaru wide-field imaging with five-band Subaru + KPNO photometry, we place tight new constraints on the halo virial mass M vir = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1015 M &sun; h -1 70 (within r vir ≈ 3 Mpc h -1 70) and concentration c vir = 6.2 $\pm$ 0.3 when assuming a spherical halo. This agrees broadly with average c(M, z) predictions from recent LambdaCDM simulations, which span 5 <~ langcrang <~ 8. Our most significant systematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight (LOS). To estimate this, we also derive a mass profile based on archival Chandra X-ray observations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile at r 2500 ~ 600 kpc. Agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axis ratio along our LOS. For this elongated halo model, we find M vir = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1015 M &sun; h -1 70 and c vir = 4.6 $\pm$ 0.2, placing rough lower limits on these values. The need for halo elongation can be partially obviated by non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors in the X-ray mass measurements. We estimate the effect of background structures based on MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find that these tend to lower M vir further by ~7% and increase c vir by ~5%.},

	Abstract = {We present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with a photometric redshift of z = 10.7+0.6 -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z < 9.5 galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2sigma). This J-dropout Lyman break galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of ~80, 7, and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude AB (~0.15 muJy) in the WFC3/IR F160W filter (~1.4-1.7 mum) where they are detected at gsim12sigma. All three images are also confidently detected at gsim6sigma in F140W (~1.2-1.6 mum), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength Hubble Space Telescope filters (~0.2-1.4 mum), and lacking bright detections in Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 mum and 4.5 mum imaging (~3.2-5.0 mum). We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift interlopers, including some previously published as high-redshift candidates. Our high-redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected a Bayesian photometric redshift prior. Given CLASH observations of 17 high-mass clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z ~ 10.8 and MACS1149-JD at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts. This would suggest that low-luminosity galaxies could have reionized the universe. However, given the significant uncertainties based on only two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop-off in number counts at z >~ 10 suggested by field searches.},

	Abstract = {We use the deep ground-based optical photometry of the Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) Survey to derive robust measurements of the faint-end slope (alpha) of the UV luminosity function (LF) at redshifts 1.9 <= z <= 3.4. Our sample includes >2000 spectroscopic redshifts and ≈31000 LBGs in 31 spatially independent fields over a total area of 3261 arcmin2. These data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07L* and 0.10L* at z ~ 2 and z ~ 3, respectively. A maximum-likelihood analysis indicates steep values of alpha(z = 2) = -1.73 $\pm$ 0.07 and alpha(z = 3) = -1.73 $\pm$ 0.13. This result is robust to luminosity-dependent systematics in the Lyalpha equivalent width and reddening distributions, and is similar to the steep values advocated at z gsim 4, and implies that ≈93% of the unobscured UV luminosity density at z ~ 2-3 arises from sub-L* galaxies. With a realistic luminosity-dependent reddening distribution, faint to moderately luminous galaxies account for gsim70% and gsim25% of the bolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density, respectively, when integrated over 1.9 <= z < 3.4. We find a factor of 8-9 increase in the star-formation rate density between z ~ 6 and z ~ 2, due to both a brightening of L* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lower redshifts. Combining the UV LF with stellar mass estimates suggests a relatively steep low-mass slope of the stellar mass function at high redshift. The previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the star-formation history and stellar mass density measurements at z ~ 2 may be reconciled by invoking a luminosity-dependent reddening correction to the star-formation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed by UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant faint-end slope of the UV LF at z gsim 2 contrasts with the shallower slope inferred locally, suggesting that the evolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability of low-mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z lsim 2.  Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {We assess the possibility of determining the Hubble constant H0 by measuring time delays between multiple images of supernovae gravitationally lensed by rich clusters of galaxies and combining these delay measurements with detailed cluster potential models based on other lensing constraints. Such a lensing determination of H0 would be complementary to those obtained from galaxy-quasar lensing studies and could potentially be better calibrated. We show that relatively low-redshift (z~0.2), significantly elliptical clusters have appreciable lensing cross sections for observable image pairings with tractable time delays on the order of a few years despite large lensing mass scales. We find that a targeted search for such image pairs would be a significant undertaking for current observatories but that it would be appropriate for a facility such as the proposed Large-Aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Powerful gravitational telescopes in the form of massive galaxy clusters can be used to enhance the light collecting power over a limited field of view by about an order of magnitude in flux. This effect is exploited here to increase the depth of a survey for lensed supernovae at near-IR wavelengths.  Methods: We present a pilot supernova search programme conducted with the ISAAC camera at VLT. Lensed galaxies behind the massive clusters A1689, A1835, and AC114 were observed for a total of 20 h divided into 2, 3, and 4 epochs respectively, separated by approximately one month to a limiting magnitude J ≲ 24 (Vega). Image subtractions including another 20 h worth of archival ISAAC/VLT data were used to search for transients with lightcurve properties consistent with redshifted supernovae, both in the new and reference data.  Results: The feasibility of finding lensed supernovae in our survey was investigated using synthetic lightcurves of supernovae and several models of the volumetric type Ia and core-collapse supernova rates as a function of redshift. We also estimate the number of supernova discoveries expected from the inferred star-formation rate in the observed galaxies. The methods consistently predict a Poisson mean value for the expected number of supernovae in the survey of between N_SN = 0.8 and 1.6 for all supernova types, evenly distributed between core collapse and type Ia supernovae. One transient object was found behind A1689, 0.5 arcsec from a galaxy with photometric redshift z_gal = 0.6 $\pm$ 0.15. The lightcurve and colors of the transient are consistent with being a reddened type IIP supernova at z_SN = 0.59. The lensing model predicts 1.4 mag of magnification at the location of the transient, without which this object would not have been detected in the near-IR ground-based search described in this paper (unlensed magnitude J ~ 25). We perform a feasibility study of the potential for lensed supernovae discoveries with larger and deeper surveys and conclude that the use of gravitational telescopes is a very exciting path for new discoveries. For example, a monthly rolling supernova search of a single very massive cluster with the HAWK-I camera at VLT would yield ≳ 10 lensed supernova lightcurves per year, where type Ia supernovae would constitute about half of the expected sample.  Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 079.A-0192 and ID 081.A-0734.},

	Abstract = {Our ability to study the most remote supernova explosions, crucial for the understanding of the evolution of the high-redshift universe and its expansion rate, is limited by the light collection capabilities of telescopes. However, nature offers unique opportunities to look beyond the range within reach of our unaided instruments thanks to the light-focusing power of massive galaxy clusters. Here we report on the discovery of one of the most distant supernovae ever found, at redshift z = 1.703. Due to a lensing magnification factor of 4.3 $\pm$ 0.3, we are able to measure a light curve of the supernova, as well as spectroscopic features of the host galaxy with a precision comparable to what would otherwise only be possible with future generation telescopes.},

	Abstract = {Any attempt to measure the Hubble constant with gravitational lens time delays is often limited by the strong degeneracy between radial mass profiles of lens galaxies and the Hubble constant. We show that strong gravitational lensing of Type Ia supernovae breaks this degeneracy; the standard candle nature of the Type Ia supernova luminosity function allows one to measure the magnification factor directly, and this information is essential to constrain radial mass profiles and the Hubble constant separately. Our numerical simulation demonstrates that the Hubble constant can be determined with ~5 per cent accuracy from several lens events only if magnification factors are used as constraints. Therefore, a distant supernova survey is a promising way to measure the global Hubble constant independently with the local estimates.},

@article{Tewes:2013b,
	Abstract = {Measuring time delays between the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars is now recognized as a competitive way to constrain the cosmological parameters, and it is complementary with other cosmological probes. This requires long and well sampled optical light curves of numerous lensed quasars, such as those obtained by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration. High-quality data from our monitoring campaign call for novel numerical techniques to robustly measure the delays, as well as the associated random and systematic uncertainties, even in the presence of microlensing variations. We propose three different point estimators to measure time delays, which are explicitly designed to handle light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach, and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods, including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard benchmark for analyzing the COSMOGRAIL light curves.},

	Abstract = {We present the results from nine years of optically monitoring the gravitationally lensed zQSO = 0.658 quasar RX J1131-1231. The R-band light curves of the four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolution photometry for a total of 707 epochs. Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three different numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5% (1sigma), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnification over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps. Finally, we find that our time-delay measurement methods yield compatible results when applied to subsets of the data.

@article{Richard:2009,
	Abstract = {Context: Strong gravitational lensing is a unique tool that can be used to accurately model the inner mass distribution of massive galaxy clusters. In particular, clusters with large Einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in the cluster core. Measuring the redshift of these multiple images provides strong constraints for precisely determining the shape of the central dark matter profile. Aims: This paper presents a spectroscopic survey of strongly lensed galaxies in the massive cluster lens Abell 1703, which displays a large Einstein radius (28´´ at z=2.8) and numerous strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-like configuration.  Methods: We used the LRIS spectrograph on Keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxy candidates, and used the measured spectroscopic redshifts to constrain the mass distribution of the cluster using a parametric model. Results: The spectroscopic data enable us to measure accurate redshifts for 7 sources at z>2 , all of which are in good agreement with their photometric redshifts. We update the identification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and identifying a radial counter image. We also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6 L* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask and it is only moderately magnified by the cluster (mu˜3.0$\pm$0.08). The improved parametric mass model, including 16 multiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains the smooth cluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized NFW profile of best-fit logarithmic slope alpha=0.92$\pm$0.04, concentration c200=4.72$\pm$0.40 and scale radius rs =476$\pm$45 kpc. The overall rms in the image plane is 1.3´´.   Conclusions: Our strong-lensing model allows us to predict a large-scale shear signal that is consistent with weak-lensing measurements inferred from Subaru data out to 4 Mpc h-1. Also considering the strong-lensing modeling requires a single dark matter clump, this suggests that Abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster. This unique cluster could be probed further using deep X-ray, SZ, and dynamics analysis for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster.},

	Abstract = {Properties of dark matter haloes can be probed observationally and numerically, and comparing both approaches provides ways to constrain cosmological models. When it comes to the inner part of galaxy cluster scale haloes, interaction between the baryonic and the dark matter component is an important issue that is far from being fully understood. With this work, we aim to initiate a program coupling observational and numerical studies to probe the inner part of galaxy clusters. In this article, we apply strong lensing techniques on Abell 1703, a massive X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.28. Our analysis is based on imaging data from both the space and ground in 8 bands, complemented by a spectroscopic survey. Abell 1703 is rather circular from the general shape of its multiply imaged systems and is dominated by a giant elliptical cD galaxy in its centre. This cluster exhibits a remarkable bright central ring formed by 4 images at z_spec = 0.888 only 5-13 arcsec away from the cD centre. This unique feature offers a rare lensing constrain for probing the central mass distribution. The stellar contribution from the cD galaxy (˜1.25 × 1012 Msun within 30 kpc) is accounted for in our parametric mass modelling, and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described using a generalized nfw profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope alpha. The rms of our mass model in the image plane is equal to 1.4 arcsec. We find that within the range where observational constraints are present (from  20 kpc to  210 kpc), alpha is equal to 1.09+0.05-0.11 (3sigma confidence level). The concentration parameter is equal to c200   3.5, and the scale radius is constrained to be larger than the region where observational constraints are available (rs =730^+15-75 kpc). The 2D mass is equal to {M} (210 kpc) = 2.4 × 1014 Msun. However, we cannot draw any conclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results from realistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison. We advocate the need for a large sample of well observed (and well constrained) and simulated unimodal relaxed galaxy clusters in order to make reliable comparisons and to potentially provide a test of cosmological models.

@article{Bradac:2008,
	Abstract = {We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g., self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACS J0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray-emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4 sigma significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray-emitting gas (the main baryonic component) but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09+0.07-0.03) and stars (0.010+0.007-0.004), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross section of sigma/m<4 cm2 g-1, reaffirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO11100 and GO10703. This work is also based on observations collected at the W. M. Keck Observatory.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a z phot = 6.18+0.05 - 0.07 (95% confidence level) dwarf galaxy, lensed into four images by the galaxy cluster MACS J0329.6-0211 (zl = 0.45). The galaxy is observed as a high-redshift dropout in HST/ACS/WFC3 CLASH and Spitzer/IRAC imaging. Its redshift is securely determined due to a clear detection of the Lyman break in the 18-band photometry, making this galaxy one of the highest-redshift multiply lensed objects known to date with an observed magnitude of F125W =24.00 $\pm$ 0.04 AB mag for its most magnified image. We also present the first strong-lensing analysis of this cluster uncovering 15 additional multiply imaged candidates of five lower-redshift sources spanning the range zs ~= 2-4. The mass model independently supports the high photometric redshift and reveals magnifications of 11.6+8.9 - 4.1, 17.6+6.2 - 3.9, 3.9+3.0 - 1.7, and 3.7+1.3 - 0.2, respectively, for the four images of the high-redshift galaxy. By delensing the most magnified image we construct an image of the source with a physical resolution of ~200 pc when the universe was ~0.9 Gyr old, where the z ~= 6.2 galaxy occupies a source-plane area of approximately 2.2 kpc2. Modeling the observed spectral energy distribution using population synthesis models, we find a demagnified stellar mass of ˜10^{9} {M}_{&sun;}, subsolar metallicity (Z/Z &sun; ~ 0.5), low dust content (AV ~ 0.1 mag), a demagnified star formation rate (SFR) of ˜3.2 {M}_{&sun;} yr-1, and a specific SFR of ~3.4 Gyr-1, all consistent with the properties of local dwarf galaxies.},

The equivalent circular Einstein radius is theta e  = 55'' $\pm$ 3'' (at an estimated source redshift of zs ~ 2.5), corresponding to re sime 350 $\pm$ 20 kpc at the cluster redshift, nearly three times greater than that of A1689 (re sime 140 kpc for zs = 2.5). The mass enclosed by this critical curve is very large, 7.4 $\pm$ 0.5 × 1014 M sun and only weakly model dependent, with a relatively shallow mass profile within r < 250 kpc, reflecting the unrelaxed appearance of this cluster. This shallow profile generates a much higher level of magnification than the well-known relaxed lensing clusters of higher concentration, so that the area of sky exceeding a magnification of >10 times, is sime3.5squ' for sources with z sime 8, making MACS J0717.5+3745 a compelling target for accessing faint objects at high redshift. We calculate that only one such cluster, with theta e  >= 55'', is predicted within ~107 Universes with z >= 0.55, corresponding to a virial mass >=3 × 1015 M sun, for the standard LambdaCDM (WMAP5 parameters with 2sigma uncertainties).},

	Abstract = {We present an improved strong-lensing analysis of Cl0024+1654 (z = 0.39) using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/NIC3 images, based on 33 multiply-lensed images of 11 background galaxies. These are found with a model that assumes mass approximately traces light, with a low-order expansion to allow for flexibility on large scales. The model is constrained initially by the well-known five-image system (z = 1.675) and refined as new multiply-lensed systems are identified using the model. Photometric redshifts of these new systems are then used to constrain better the mass profile by adopting the standard cosmological relation between redshift and lensing distance. Our model requires only six free parameters to describe well all positional and redshift data. The resulting inner mass profile has a slope of d logM/d logr ~= -0.55, consistent with new weak-lensing measurements where the data overlap, at r ~= 200 kpc/h70. The combined profile is well fitted by a high-concentration Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) mass profile, Cvir ~ 8.6 +/- 1.6, similar to other well-studied clusters, but larger than predicted with standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM). A well-defined radial critical curve is generated by the model and is clearly observed at r ~= 12 arcsec, outlined by elongated images pointing towards the centre of mass. The relative fluxes of the multiply-lensed images are found to agree well with the modelled magnifications, providing an independent consistency check.},

	Abstract = {We analyze deep multicolor Advanced Camera images of the largest known gravitational lens, A1689. Radial and tangential arcs delineate the critical curves in unprecedented detail, and many small counterimages are found near the center of mass. We construct a flexible light deflection field to predict the appearance and positions of counterimages. The model is refined as new counterimages are identified and incorporated to improve the model, yielding a total of 106 images of 30 multiply lensed background galaxies, spanning a wide redshift range, 1.0<z<5.5. The resulting mass map is more circular in projection than the clumpy distribution of cluster galaxies, and the light is more concentrated than the mass within r<50 kpc h-1. The projected mass profile flattens steadily toward the center with a shallow mean slope of dlogSigma/dlogr~=-0.55+/-0.1, over the observed range r<250 kpc h-1, matching well an NFW profile, but with a relatively high concentration, Cvir=8.2+2.1-1.8. A softened isothermal profile (rcore=20+/-2") is not conclusively excluded, illustrating that lensing constrains only projected quantities. Regarding cosmology, we clearly detect the purely geometric increase of bend angles with redshift. The dependence on the cosmological parameters is weak owing to the proximity of A1689, z=0.18, constraining the locus, OmegaM+OmegaLambda<=1.2. This consistency with standard cosmology provides independent support for our model, because the redshift information is not required to derive an accurate mass map. Similarly, the relative fluxes of the multiple images are reproduced well by our best-fitting lens model.},

@article{Inada:2003,
	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. The cold-dark-matter model of the formation of large-scale structures (that is, clusters of galaxies and even larger assemblies) predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensed by concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would be split by over 7arcsec. Numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasars have, however, been unsuccessful. All of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known, including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that can be explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter. Although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known, quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of the resulting lens systems. Here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, SDSS J1004 + 4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. Such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominated by dark matter. Our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectations based on the cold-dark-matter model.},

@article{Dahle:2013,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a unique gravitational lens system, SDSS J2222+2745, producing five spectroscopically confirmed images of a zs = 2.82 quasar lensed by a foreground galaxy cluster at zl = 0.49. We also present photometric and spectroscopic evidence for a sixth lensed image of the same quasar. The maximum separation between the quasar images is 15.''1. Both the large image separations and the high image multiplicity are in themselves rare among known lensed quasars, and observing the combination of these two factors is an exceptionally unlikely occurrence in present data sets. This is only the third known case of a quasar lensed by a cluster, and the only one with six images. The lens system was discovered in the course of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey, in which we identify candidate lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and target these for follow-up and verification with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope. Multi-band photometry obtained over multiple epochs from 2011 September to 2012 September reveals significant variability at the ~10%-30% level in some of the quasar images, indicating that measurements of the relative time delay between quasar images will be feasible. In this lens system, we also identify a bright (g = 21.5) giant arc corresponding to a strongly lensed background galaxy at zs = 2.30. We fit parametric models of the lens system, constrained by the redshift and positions of the quasar images and the redshift and position of the giant arc. The predicted time delays between different pairs of quasar images range from ~100 days to ~6 yr.  Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.},

@article{Oguri:2008,
	Abstract = {We identify a third image in the unique quasar lens SDSS J1029+2623, the second known quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies. The spectrum of the third image shows similar emission and absorption features but has a redder continuum than the other two images, which can be explained by differential extinction or microlensing. We also identify several lensed arcs. Our observations suggest a complicated structure of the lens cluster at z~0.6. We argue that the three lensed images are produced by a naked cusp on the basis of successful mass models, the distribution of cluster member galaxies, and the shapes and locations of the lensed arcs. Lensing by a naked cusp is quite rare among galaxy-scale lenses but is predicted to be common among large-separation lensed quasars. Thus the discovery can be viewed as support for an important theoretical prediction of the standard cold dark matter model.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. This work is based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Use of the UH 2.2 m telescope for the observations is supported by NAOJ.},

	Abstract = {I review the current state of determinations of the Hubble constant, which gives the length scale of the Universe by relating the expansion velocity of objects to their distance. In the last 20 years, much progress has been made and estimates now range between 60 and 75 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, with most now between 70 and 75 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, a huge improvement over the factor-of-2 uncertainty which used to prevail. Further improvements which gave a generally agreed margin of error of a few percent rather than the current 10% would be vital input to much other interesting cosmology. There are several programmes which are likely to lead us to this point in the next 10 years.},

@article{Suyu:2013,
	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multiple images and models of the lens mass distribution allow a one-step determination of the time-delay distance, and thus a measure of cosmological parameters. We present a blind analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131-1231 incorporating (1) the newly measured time delays from COSMOGRAIL, the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses, (2) archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the lens system, (3) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of the lens galaxy of 323 $\pm$ 20 km s-1 based on Keck spectroscopy, and (4) a characterization of the line-of-sight structures via observations of the lens' environment and ray tracing through the Millennium Simulation. Our blind analysis is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a time-delay distance measurement to 6% precision that takes into account all known systematic uncertainties. In combination with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year (WMAP7) data set in flat wCDM cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for RXJ1131-1231 are H_0=80.0^{+5.8}_{-5.7} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Omegade = 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03, and w=-1.25^{+0.17}_{-0.21}. We find the results to be statistically consistent with those from the analysis of the gravitational lens B1608+656, permitting us to combine the inferences from these two lenses. The joint constraints from the two lenses and WMAP7 are H_0=75.2^{+4.4}_{-4.2} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Omega _de=0.76^{+0.02}_{-0.03}, and w = -1.14^{+0.17}_{-0.20} in flat wCDM, and H_0=73.1^{+2.4}_{-3.6} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Omega_{Lambda}= 0.75^{+0.01}_{-0.02}, and Omega_k=0.003^{+0.005}_{-0.006} in open LambdaCDM. Time-delay lenses constrain especially tightly the Hubble constant H 0 (5.7% and 4.0% respectively in wCDM and open LambdaCDM) and curvature of the universe. The overall information content is similar to that of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation experiments. Thus, they complement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check of unknown systematics. Our measurement of the Hubble constant is completely independent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing an important consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of general relativity.},

	Abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 $\pm$ 15 km s-1 for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens' environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and the external convergence kappaext we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma' = 2.08 $\pm$ 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for kappaext: 0.10+0.08 -0.05. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H 0. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Omegam = 0.3, OmegaLambda = 0.7, and w = -1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we find H 0 = 70.6+3.1 -3.1 km s-1 Mpc-1. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over kappaext. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Omegam and OmegaLambda at w = -1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 < Omegak < 0.009 (95% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with WMAP, H 0 = 69.7+4.9 -5.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 and w = -0.94+0.17 -0.19 (68% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.  Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program No. GO-10158.},

	Abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 < z < 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 mum. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ~109.5 M &sun; at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z <= 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <1010 M &sun; that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ~ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M &sun;) ~ 10.65 and ~ - 1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M &sun;) has increased by a factor of ~12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ~2.2.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {Time delays in strong gravitational lensing systems possess significant complementarity with distance measurements to determine the dark energy equation of state, as well as the matter density and Hubble constant. Time delays are most useful when observations permit detailed lens modeling and variability studies, requiring high resolution imaging, long time monitoring, and rapid cadence. We quantify the constraints possible between a sample of 150 such time delay lenses and a near term supernova program, such as might become available from an Antarctic telescope such as the KDUST and the Dark Energy Survey. Adding time delay data to supernovae plus cosmic microwave background information can improve the dark energy figure of merit by almost a factor 5 and determine the matter density Omegam to 0.004, the Hubble constant h to 0.7%, and the dark energy equation of state time variation wa to 0.26, systematics permitting.},

	Abstract = {Strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effective probe of dark energy. Recent studies have shown that a single lens can provide a distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematic uncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the time delay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector. Gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow one to break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probes like the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation of state. Current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensed quasars, but this situation is about to change. Even in this decade, wide field imaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enabling the targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gains in the dark energy figure of merit. In the next decade, a further order of magnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to be detected and measured with LSST and Euclid. To fully exploit these gains, we identify three priorities. First, support for the development of software required for the analysis of the data. Second, in this decade, small robotic telescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars will transform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. Third, in the 2020's, LSST will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck will instead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up. Thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolution imaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the James Webb Space Telescope and next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.},

@article{Diego:2014,
	Abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 has revealed an exceptional number of strongly lensed multiply-imaged galaxies, including high-redshift candidates. Previous studies have used this data to obtain the most detailed dark matter reconstructions of any galaxy cluster to date, resolving substructures ~25 kpc across. We examine Abell 1689 (hereafter, A1689) non-parametrically, combining strongly lensed images and weak distortions from wider field Subaru imaging, and we incorporate member galaxies to improve the lens solution. Strongly lensed galaxies are often locally affected by member galaxies, however, these perturbations cannot be recovered in grid based reconstructions because the lensing information is too sparse to resolve member galaxies. By adding luminosity-scaled member galaxy deflections to our smooth grid we can derive meaningful solutions with sufficient accuracy to permit the identification of our own strongly lensed images, so our model becomes self consistent. We identify 11 new multiply lensed system candidates and clarify previously ambiguous cases, in the deepest optical and NIR data to date from Hubble and Subaru. Our improved spatial resolution brings up new features not seen when the weak and strong lensing effects are used separately, including clumps and filamentary dark matter around the main halo. Our treatment means we can obtain an objective mass ratio between the cluster and galaxy components, for examining the extent of tidal stripping of the luminous member galaxies. We find a typical mass-to-light ratios of M/L_B = 21 inside the r<1 arcminute region that drops to M/L_B = 17 inside the r<40 arcsecond region. Our model independence means we can objectively evaluate the competitiveness of stacking cluster lenses for defining the geometric lensing-distance-redshift relation in a model independent way.},

	Abstract = {We present the supernova (SN) sample and Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rates from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 SNe discovered in the parallel fields. Of these SNe, ~13 are classified as SN Ia candidates, including four SN Ia candidates at redshifts z > 1.2. We measure volumetric SN Ia rates to redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the SN Ia rate in the range 1.8 < z < 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the HST/GOODS and Subaru Deep Field SN surveys. We model these results together with previous measurements at z < 1 from the literature. The best-fitting SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and subsequent SN Ia explosions) is a power law with an index of -1.00^{+0.06(0.09)}_{-0.06(0.10)}\ (statistical) ^{+0.12}_{-0.08}\ (systematic), where the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68% and 95% (in parentheses) statistical uncertainties reported for the various SN Ia rates (from this work and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test DTD models produced by an assortment of published binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations. The shapes of all BPS double-degenerate DTDs are consistent with the volumetric SN Ia measurements, when the DTD models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In contrast, all BPS single-degenerate DTDs are ruled out by the measurements at >99% significance level.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the rates of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae derived from the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS). We carried out repeat deep imaging observations with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, and detected 1040 variable objects over 0.918 deg$^2$ in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. From the imaging observations, light curves in the observed $i'$-band are constructed for all objects, and we fit the observed light curves with template light curves. Out of the 1040 variable objects detected by the SXDS, 39 objects over the redshift range $0.2 < z < 1.4$ are classified as Type Ia supernovae using the light curves. These are among the most distant SN Ia rate measurements to date. We find that the Type Ia supernova rate increase up to $z \sim 0.8$ and may then flatten at higher redshift. The rates can be fitted by a simple power law, $r_V(z)=r_0(1+z)^\alpha$ with $r_0=0.20^{+0.52}_{-0.16}$(stat.)$^{+0.26}_{-0.07}$(syst.)$\times 10^{-4} {\rm yr}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, and $\alpha=2.04^{+1.84}_{-1.96}$(stat.)$^{+2.11}_{-0.86}$(syst.).},

@article{Matteucci:2006,
	Abstract = {In recent papers, Mannucci et al. and Mannucci, Della Valle & Panagia suggested, on the basis of observational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay times for the explosion of Type Ia supernovae (SNe). In particular, a percentage from 35 to 50 per cent of the total Type Ia SNe should be composed by systems with lifetimes as short as 108 yr, whereas the rest should arise from smaller mass progenitors with a much broader distribution of lifetimes. In this paper, we test this hypothesis in models of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type: ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We show that this proposed scenario is compatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. In this new formulation, we simply assume that Type Ia SNe are originating from C-O white dwarfs in binary systems without specifying if the progenitor model is the single-degenerate or the double-degenerate one or a mixture of both. In the framework of the single-degenerate model, such a bimodal distribution of the time delays could be explained if the binary systems with a unitary mass ratio are favoured in the mass range 5-8 Msolar, whereas for masses <5Msolar the favoured systems should have the mass of the primary much larger than the mass of the secondary. When the new rate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type Ia SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very early epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more than in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SN Ia rate. As a consequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] > -2.0 dex, relative to the old models. For a typical elliptical of 1011Msolar of luminous mass, the new rate produces average [alpha/Fe] ratios in the dominant stellar population still in agreement with observations. The Type Ia SN rate also in this case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to the previous results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of our Galaxy. We have also checked the effects of the new Type Ia SN rate on the evolution of the Fe content in the intracluster medium (ICM), as a consequence of its production from cluster ellipticals and we found that less Fe in the ICM is produced with the new rate, due to the higher fraction of Fe synthesized at early times and remaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. For dwarf irregular galaxies suffering few bursts of star formation, we obtain [O/Fe] ratios larger by 0.2 dex relative to the previous models.},

	Abstract = {The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) has performed, during the period 2004-2009, the optical and NIR follow up of 253 supernovae (SNe) of all types. Among those, 124 were core collapse events, comprising 93 SNe of type II and 31 of types Ib/Ic/IIb. Our follow up consisted of photometric observations suitable to build detailed light curves and a considerable amount of optical spectroscopy.  The bulk of our observations is carried out at Las Campanas Observatory, while access to other facilities is also provided thanks to our strong collaboration with the Millennium Center for Supernova Studies (MCSS).  Our spectroscopic observations were primarily aimed at typing possible new SNe, and follow-up the evolution of CSP targets. One of the goals of the follow-up of type II SNe is the application of independent distance indicators such as the Standard Candle (SCM) and the Expanding Photosphere (EPM) methods. Moreover, through the study of the spectroscopic evolution of these objects, from as early as possible after explosion to the nebular phases, we hope to contribute to their further understanding. Specific analysis of particular objects is underway by members of the CSP and an extended collaboration.},

	Abstract = {A detailed study spanning approximately a year has been conducted on the Type Ib supernova (SN) 2007Y. Imaging was obtained from X-ray to radio wavelengths, and a comprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'UBVYJHKs ) light curves and optical spectroscopy is presented. A virtually complete bolometric light curve is derived, from which we infer a 56Ni mass of 0.06 M sun. The early spectrum strongly resembles SN 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of Ca II and Halpha during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of an ejecta-wind interaction. Nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profiles that indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. Late phase spectra are modeled with a non-LTE code, from which we find 56Ni, O, and total-ejecta masses (excluding He) to be 0.06, 0.2, and 0.42 M sun, respectively, below 4500 km s-1. The 56Ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric light curve. The oxygen abundance suggests that the progenitor was most likely a ≈3.3 M sun He core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13 M sun. The explosion energy is determined to be ≈1050 erg, and the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is constrained from X-ray and radio observations to be lsim10-6 M sun yr-1. SN 2007Y is among the least energetic normal Type Ib SNe ever studied.  Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla and Paranal Observatories, Chile (ESO Programme 078.D-0048 and 380.D-0272).},

	Abstract = {Supernovae are essential to understanding the chemical evolution of the universe. Type Ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational tool currently available for studying the expansion history of the universe and the nature of dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study of their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently available data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae are rather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are poorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose spectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with precise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing photometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on telescope/filter/detector systems that are well understood and well characterized. During a 5 year program that began in 2004 September, we expect to obtain high-precision u'g'r'i'BVYJHKs light curves and optical spectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the CSP survey observing and data reduction methodology. In addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectra obtained for a few representative supernovae during the first observing campaign.},

	Abstract = {We apply the Standardized Candle Method (SCM) for Type II Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a SN to its luminosity during the plateau, to 15 SNe II-P discovered over the three season run of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey. The redshifts of these SNe---0.027 < z < 0.144---cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature; in particular, our SNe II-P sample contains nearly as many SNe in the Hubble flow (z > 0.01) as all of the current literature on the SCM combined. We find that the SDSS SNe have a very small intrinsic I-band dispersion (0.22 mag), which can be attributed to selection effects. When the SCM is applied to the combined SDSS-plus-literature set of SNe II-P, the dispersion increases to 0.29 mag, larger than the scatter for either set of SNe separately. We show that the standardization cannot be further improved by eliminating SNe with positive plateau decline rates, as proposed in Poznanski et al. We thoroughly examine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the SCM to be useful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the Fe II velocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompass the intrinsic variations of Type II-P SNe will be needed.  Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

@article{Greggio:2010,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the possible systematic difference of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) properties related to the age and masses of the progenitors that could introduce a systematic bias between low- and high-redshift SNe Ia. The relation between the main features of the distribution of delay times and the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double degenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the SD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed correlations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is shown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single-channel and mixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide clues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide range of masses for the CO white dwarf at the start of accretion is expected in almost all galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types are the properties of the progenitors expected to be more uniform. For mixed models, late-type galaxies should host SD and DD explosions in comparable fractions, while in early-type galaxies DD explosions should largely prevail. Events hosted by star-forming galaxies span a wide range of delay times; prompt events could dominate only in the presence of a strong starburst. It is concluded that nearby SN Ia samples should well include the young, massive and hot progenitors that necessarily dominate at high redshift.},

White dwarf number densities in globular clusters allow 10-100, redshift <~1 collisions per year, and observations by Chomiuk et al. of globular clusters in the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 7457 have detected what is likely to be a SNIa remnant. We carry out simulations of the collision between two 0.6Msolar white dwarfs at various impact parameters and mass resolutions. For impact parameters less than half the radius of the white dwarf, we find such collisions produce ~0.4Msolar of56Ni, making such events potential candidates for underluminous SNIa or a new class of transients between Novae and SNIa.},

	Abstract = {The time delay between the formation of a population of stars and the onset of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sets important limits on the masses and nature of SN Ia progenitors. Here, we use a new observational technique to measure this time delay by comparing the spatial distributions of SNe Ia to their local environments. Previous work attempted such analyses encompassing the entire host of each SN Ia, yielding inconclusive results. Our approach confines the analysis only to the relevant portions of the hosts, allowing us to show that even so-called prompt SNe Ia that trace star formation on cosmic timescales exhibit a significant delay time of 200-500 million years. This implies that either the majority of Ia companion stars have main-sequence masses less than 3 M sun, or that most SNe Ia arise from double white dwarf binaries. Our results are also consistent with a SNe Ia rate that traces the white dwarf formation rate, scaled by a fixed efficiency factor.},

	Abstract = {Ongoing searches for supernovae (SNe) at cosmological distances have recently started to provide a link between SN Ia statistics and galaxy evolution. We use recent estimates of the global history of star formation to compute the theoretical Type Ia and Type II SN rates as a function of cosmic time from the present epoch to high redshifts. We show that accurate measurements of the frequency of SN events in the range 0<z<1 will be valuable probes of the nature of Type Ia progenitors and the evolution of the stellar birth rate in the Universe. The Next Generation Space Telescope should detect of order 20 Type II SNe per 4x4 arcmin^2 field per year in the interval 1<z<4.},

	Abstract = {We present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) PS1-11ap, discovered with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey at z = 0.524. This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to reach a peak magnitude of Mu = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 × 1043 erg s-1 before settling on to a relatively shallow gradient of decline. The observed decline is significantly slower than those of the SLSNe-Ic which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic similarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to 56Co decay time-scale initially indicated that this transient could be a candidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the transient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object PTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 d before peak to 230 d after, allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN explosions. We find that the PS1-11ap data do not match these model explosion parameters well, supporting the recent claim that these SNe are not pair instability explosions. We show that PS1-11ap has many features in common with the faster declining SLSNe-Ic, and the light-curve evolution can also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin-down model. At a redshift of z = 0.524, the observer-frame optical coverage provides comprehensive rest-frame UV data and allows us to compare it with the SLSNe recently found at high redshifts between z = 2 and 4. While these high-z explosions are still plausible PISN candidates, they match the photometric evolution of PS1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lower redshift transient.},

@article{Foley:2013c,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for probabilistically classifying supernovae (SNe) without using SN spectral or photometric data. Unlike all previous studies to classify SNe without spectra, this technique does not use any SN photometry. Instead, the method relies on host-galaxy data. We build upon the well-known correlations between SN classes and host-galaxy properties, specifically that core-collapse SNe rarely occur in red, luminous, or early-type galaxies. Using the nearly spectroscopically complete Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample of SNe, we determine SN fractions as a function of host-galaxy properties. Using these data as inputs, we construct a Bayesian method for determining the probability that an SN is of a particular class. This method improves a common classification figure of merit by a factor of >2, comparable to the best light-curve classification techniques. Of the galaxy properties examined, morphology provides the most discriminating information. We further validate this method using SN samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Palomar Transient Factory. We demonstrate that this method has wide-ranging applications, including separating different subclasses of SNe and determining the probability that an SN is of a particular class before photometry or even spectra can. Since this method uses completely independent data from light-curve techniques, there is potential to further improve the overall purity and completeness of SN samples and to test systematic biases of the light-curve techniques. Further enhancements to the host-galaxy method, including additional host-galaxy properties, combination with light-curve methods, and hybrid methods, should further improve the quality of SN samples from past, current, and future transient surveys.},

@article{Maoz:2014,
	Abstract = {Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important distance indicators, element factories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic-energy sources in galaxy evolution, and endpoints of stellar binary evolution. It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a non-degenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of their sites, pre- and post-explosion, from analysis of the explosions themselves, and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive, and sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

@article{Maguire:2013,
	Abstract = {A key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying Na I D absorption lines, interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor system. The origin of this material is controversial, but the simplest explanation is that it results from previous mass-loss in a system containing a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. We present new single-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift SNe Ia taken with XShooter on the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope. Combining this sample with events from the literature, we confirm an excess (˜20 per cent) of SNe Ia displaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features compared to redshifted Na I D features. The host galaxies of SNe Ia displaying blueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies, compared to SNe Ia that show no Na I D absorption and SNe Ia displaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features have broader light curves. The strength of the Na I D absorption is stronger in SNe Ia displaying blueshifted Na I D absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and the strength of the blueshifted Na I D is correlated with the B - V colour of the SN at maximum light. This strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to the SN. In the context of the progenitor systems of SNe Ia, we discuss the significance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on the nature of SN Ia progenitors. We present a summary that suggests that there are at least two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {We report results from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPhotCC), a publicly released mix of simulated supernovae (SNe), with types (Ia, Ibc, and II) selected in proportion to their expected rates. The simulation was realized in the g r i z filters of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with realistic observing conditions (sky noise, point-spread function, and atmospheric transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site. Simulations of non-Ia-type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). A spectroscopically confirmed subset was provided for training. We challenged scientists to run their classification algorithms and report a type and photo- z for each SN. Participants from 10 groups contributed 13 entries for the sample that included a host-galaxy photo- z for each SN and nine entries for the sample that had no redshift information. Several different classification strategies resulted in similar performance, and for all entries the performance was significantly better for the training subset than for the unconfirmed sample. For the spectroscopically unconfirmed subset, the entry with the highest average figure of merit for classifying SNe Ia has an efficiency of 0.96 and an SN Ia purity of 0.79. As a public resource for the future development of photometric SN classification and photo- z estimators, we have released updated simulations with improvements based on our experience from the SNPhotCC, added samples corresponding to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the SDSS-II, and provided the answer keys so that developers can evaluate their own analysis.},

	Abstract = {Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 1044 ergs per second at their peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of `pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of 56Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to 56Fe via 56Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6×10-6 times that of the core-collapse rate.},

	Abstract = {We carried out an experiment to determine whether student learning gains in
a large, traditionally taught, upper-division lecture course in developmental
biology could be increased by partially changing to a more interactive
classroom format. In two successive semesters, we presented the same course
syllabus using different teaching styles: in fall 2003, the traditional
lecture format; and in spring 2004, decreased lecturing and addition of
student participation and cooperative problem solving during class time,
including frequent in-class assessment of understanding. We used performance
on pretests and posttests, and on homework problems to estimate and compare
student learning gains between the two semesters. Our results indicated
significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the
more interactive course. To assess reproducibility of these effects, we
repeated the interactive course in spring 2005 with similar results. Our
findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other
disciplines. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a general model for
teaching large biology courses that incorporates interactive engagement and
cooperative work in place of some lecturing, while retaining course content by
demanding greater student responsibility for learning outside of class.},

@article{Maoz:2012,
	Abstract = {The identity of the progenitor systems of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics. SN Ia rates are providing some striking clues. We review the basics of SN rate measurement, preach about some sins of SN rate measurement and analysis, and illustrate one of these sins with an analogy about Martian scientists. We review the recent progress in measuring SN Ia rates in various environments and redshifts, and their use to reconstruct the SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation. A good number of DTD measurements, using a variety of methods, appear to be converging. At delays 1<t<10Gyr, these measurements show a similar, ~t-1, power-law shape. The DTD peaks at the shortest delays probed. This result supports the idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for SNe Ia. Single-degenerate progenitors may still play a role in producing short-delay SNe Ia, or perhaps all SNe Ia, if the red-giant donor channel is more efficient than is found by most theoretical models. The DTD normalization enjoys fairly good agreement (though perhaps some tension), among the various measurements, with a Hubble time-integrated DTD value of about 2+/-1 SNe Ia per 1000Msolar (stellar mass formed with a low-mass turnover initial mass function). The local WD binary population suggests that the WD merger rate can explain the Galactic SN Ia rate, but only if sub-Chandra mergers lead to SN Ia events. We point to some future directions that should lead to progress in the field, including measurement of the bivariate (delay and stretch) SN Ia response function.},

	Abstract = {Thermonuclear supernovae result when interaction with a companion reignites nuclear fusion in a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, causing a thermonuclear runaway, a catastrophic gain in pressure, and the disintegration of the whole white dwarf. It is usually thought that fusion is reignited in near-pycnonuclear conditions when the white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar mass. I briefly describe two long-standing problems faced by this scenario, and our suggestion that these supernovae instead result from mergers of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass remnants. I then turn to possible observational tests, in particular those that test the absence or presence of electron captures during the burning.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by the fact that calibrated light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have become a major tool to determine the expansion history of the Universe, considerable attention has been given to, both, observations and models of these events over the past 15 years. Here, we summarize new observational constraints, address recent progress in modeling Type Ia supernovae by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and discuss several of the still open questions. It will be be shown that the new models have considerable predictive power which allows us to study observable properties such as light curves and spectra without adjustable non-physical parameters. This is a necessary requisite to improve our understanding of the explosion mechanism and to settle the question of the applicability of SNe Ia as distance indicators for cosmology. We explore the capabilities of the models by comparing them with observations and we show how such models can be applied to study the origin of the diversity of SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {Two "twin" Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), SNe 2011by and 2011fe, have extremely similar optical light-curve shapes, colors, and spectra, yet have different ultraviolet (UV) continua as measured in Hubble Space Telescope spectra and measurably different peak luminosities. We attribute the difference in the UV continua to significantly different progenitor metallicities. This is the first robust detection of different metallicities for SN Ia progenitors. Theoretical reasoning suggests that differences in metallicity also lead to differences in luminosity. SNe Ia with higher progenitor metallicities have lower 56Ni yields and lower luminosities for the same light-curve shape. SNe 2011by and 2011fe have different peak luminosities (DeltaMV ≈ 0.6 mag), which correspond to different 56Ni yields: M_11fe(^{56}Ni) / M_11by(^{56}Ni) = 1.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}. From theoretical models that account for different neutron-to-proton ratios in progenitors, the differences in 56Ni yields for SNe 2011by and 2011fe imply that their progenitor stars were above and below solar metallicity, respectively. Although we can distinguish progenitor metallicities in a qualitative way from UV data, the quantitative interpretation in terms of abundances is limited by the present state of theoretical models.},

@article{Kelly:2008,
	Abstract = {When the afterglow fades at the site of a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB), Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) are the only type of core-collapse supernova observed. Recent work found that a sample of LGRB in high-redshift galaxies had different environments from a collection of core-collapse environments, which were identified from their colors and light curves. LGRBs were in the brightest regions of their hosts, but the core-collapse sample followed the overall distribution of the galaxy light. Here we examine 504 supernovae with types assigned based on their spectra that are located in nearby (z<0.06) galaxies for which we have constructed surface photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The distributions of the thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia) and some varieties of core-collapse supernovae (SNe II and SNe Ib) follow the galaxy light, but the SNe Ic (like LGRBs) are much more likely to erupt in the brightest regions of their hosts. The high-redshift hosts of LGRB are overwhelmingly irregulars, without bulges, while many low-redshift SNe Ic hosts are spirals with small bulges. When we remove the bulge light from our low-redshift sample, the SN Ic and LGRB distributions agree extremely well. If both LGRBs and SNe Ic stem from very massive stars, then it seems plausible that the conditions necessary for forming SNe Ic are also required for LGRBs. Additional factors, including metallicity, may determine whether the stellar evolution of a massive star leads to a LGRB with an underlying broad-lined SN Ic, or simply a SN Ic without a gamma-ray burst.},

We obtained a total of 583 orbits of HST ACS/WFC imaging in the F814W filter, covering a field that is 1.64 deg2 in area, the largest contiguous field ever imaged with HST. The median exposure depth across the field is 2028 s (one HST orbit), achieving a limiting point-source depth AB(F814W)=27.2 (5 sigma). We also present details of the astrometric image registration and distortion removal and image combination using MultiDrizzle, motivating the choice of our final pixel scale (30 mas pixel-1), based on the requirements for weak-lensing science. The final set of images are publicly available through the archive sites at IPAC and STScI, along with further documentation on how they were produced.

	Abstract = {One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events. Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of 0.9 M &sun; and 1.1 M &sun; combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color light curves of our merger, which produces about 0.62 M &sun; of 56Ni, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia.},

@article{Wiersma:2011,
	Abstract = {We investigate how a range of physical processes affect the cosmic metal distribution using a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. Focusing on redshifts z= 0 and 2, we study the metallicities and metal mass fractions for stars as well as for the interstellar medium (ISM), and several more diffuse gas phases. We vary the cooling rates, star formation law, structure of the ISM, properties of galactic winds, feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), supernova type Ia time delays, reionization, stellar initial mass function and cosmology. In all models stars and the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) constitute the dominant repository of metals, while for z≳ 2 the ISM is also important. In models with galactic winds, predictions for the metallicities of the various phases vary at the factor of 2 level and are broadly consistent with observations. The exception is the cold-warm intergalactic medium (IGM), whose metallicity varies at the order of magnitude level if the prescription for galactic winds is varied, even for a fixed wind energy per unit stellar mass formed, and falls far below the observed values if winds are not included. At the other extreme, the metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM) is largely insensitive to the presence of galactic winds, indicating that its enrichment is regulated by other processes. The mean metallicities of stars (˜Z&sun;), the ICM (˜10-1 Z&sun;), and the WHIM (˜10-1 Z&sun;) evolve only slowly, while those of the cold halo gas and the IGM increase by more than an order of magnitude from z= 5-0. Higher velocity outflows are more efficient at transporting metals to low densities, but actually predict lower metallicities for the cold-warm IGM since the winds shock-heat the gas to high temperatures, thereby increasing the fraction of the metals residing in, but not the metallicity of, the WHIM. Besides galactic winds driven by feedback from star formation, the metal distribution is most sensitive to the inclusion of metal-line cooling and feedback from AGN. We conclude that observations of the metallicity of the low-density IGM have the potential to constrain the poorly understood feedback processes that are central to current models of the formation and evolution of galaxies.},

@article{Foley:2013a,
	Abstract = {We describe observed properties of the Type Iax class of supernovae (SNe Iax), consisting of SNe observationally similar to its prototypical member, SN 2002cx. The class currently has 25 members, and we present optical photometry and/or optical spectroscopy for most of them. SNe Iax are spectroscopically similar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 <~ |v| <~ 8000 km s-1), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 >= M  V, peak >~ -18.9 mag), and most have hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for their light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and light-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia and with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is highly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in elliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars are white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra, low (typically ~0.5 M &sun;SUB>) ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray detections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN sites. However, two SNe Iax show strong He lines in their spectra. The progenitor system and explosion model that best fits all of the data is a binary system of a C/O WD that accretes matter from a He star and has a deflagration. At least some of the time, this explosion will not disrupt the WD. The small number of SNe in this class prohibit a detailed analysis of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the entire class. We estimate that in a given volume there are 31^{+17}_{-13} SNe Iax for every 100 SNe Ia, and for every 1 M &sun; of iron generated by SNe Ia at z = 0, SNe Iax generate ~0.036 M &sun;. Being the largest class of peculiar SNe, thousands of SNe Iax will be discovered by LSST. Future detailed observations of SNe Iax should further our understanding of both their progenitor systems and explosions as well as those of SNe Ia.  This paper is dedicated to the memory of our friend and colleague, Dr. Weidong Li, a pioneer in the identification and detailed study of this class of objects.},

	Abstract = {We use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currently available for GOODS-South (GOODS-S) galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. The photometry includes VLT/VIMOS (U band), HST/ACS (F435W, F606W, F775W, and F850LP bands), VLT/ISAAC (J, H, and Ks bands), and four Spitzer/IRAC channels (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm). The catalog is selected in the z band (F850LP) and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed TFIT algorithm, which performs point-spread function (PSF) matched photometry uniformly across different instruments and filters, despite large variations in PSFs and pixel scales. Photometric redshifts are derived using the GOODZ code, which is based on the template fitting method using priors. The code also implements "training" of the template spectral energy distribution (SED) set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order to minimize systematic differences between the templates and the SEDs of the observed galaxies. Our final catalog covers an area of 153 arcmin2 and includes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. The scatter between our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is σ = 0.040 with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing to σ = 0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit mz < 24.5. This is consistent with the best results previously published for GOODS-S galaxies, however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and provides photometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits and higher redshifts than earlier works. Furthermore, we show that the photometric redshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent with those expected based on the Lyman break technique.},

@article{Li:2011b,
	Abstract = {This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have considered a sample of ˜1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe Ibc and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions, inclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble types or B-K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy 'size', expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component ('tardy' and 'prompt') model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in young stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different SN types [e.g. for SNe Ia, a rate of (0.301 $\pm$ 0.062) × 10-4 SN Mpc-3 yr-1 at redshift 0] and compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we estimate the SN rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 $\pm$ 0.60 SNe per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of ˜2), consistent with published SN rates based on several different techniques.},

@article{Leaman:2011,
	Abstract = {This is the first paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. We have obtained 2.3 million observations of 14 882 sample galaxies over an interval of 11 years (1998 March to 2008 December). We considered 1036 SNe detected in our sample and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 Type Ia SNe, 116 Type Ibc SNe and Type II 324 SNe) to determine our SN rates. This is the largest and most homogeneous set of nearby SNe ever assembled for this purpose, and ours is the first local SN rate analysis based on CCD imaging and modern image-subtraction techniques. In this paper, we lay the foundation of the study. We derive the recipe for the control-time calculation for SNe with a known luminosity function and provide details on the construction of the galaxy and SN samples used in the calculations. Compared with a complete volume-limited galaxy sample, our sample has a deficit of low-luminosity galaxies but still provides enough statistics for a reliable rate calculation. There is a strong Malmquist bias, so the average size (luminosity or mass) of the galaxies increases monotonically with distance, and this trend is used to showcase a correlation between SN rates and galaxy sizes. Very few core-collapse SNe are found in early-type galaxies, providing strong constraints on the amount of recent star formation within these galaxies. The small average observation interval (˜9 d) of our survey ensures that our control-time calculations can tolerate a reasonable amount of uncertainty in the luminosity functions of SNe. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the limiting magnitude of each image and the SN detection efficiency as a function of galaxy Hubble type. The limiting magnitude and the detection efficiency, together with the luminosity function derived from a complete sample of very nearby SNe in Paper II, will be used to calculate the control time and the SN rates in Paper III.},

@article{Thompson:2011,
	Abstract = {White dwarf-white dwarf (WD-WD) and neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers may produce Type Ia supernovae and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), respectively. A general problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to merge in significantly less than the Hubble time (t H), and thus accommodate the observation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I explore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually coeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai oscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing its gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly increases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is t merge < t H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can merge in <~ t H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough inclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t merge <~ t H is yet larger. In contrast, P <~ 0.3 days is required in the absence of a tertiary. I discuss implications of these findings for the production of transients formed via compact object binary mergers. Based on the statistics of solar-type binaries, I argue that many such binaries should be in triple systems affected by the Kozai resonance. If true, expectations for the mHz GW signal from individual sources, the diffuse background, and the foreground for GW experiments like LISA are modified. This work motivates future studies of triples systems of A, B, and O stars, and new types of searches for WD-WD binaries in triple systems.},

@article{Kashi:2011,
	Abstract = {We study the final stages of the common envelope (CE) evolution and find that a substantial fraction of the ejected mass does not reach the escape velocity. To reach this conclusion we use a self-similar solution under simplifying assumptions. Most of the gravitational energy of a companion white dwarf (WD) is released in the envelope of a massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or the red giant branch (RGB) star in a very short time. This rapid energy release forms a blast wave in the envelope. We follow the blast wave propagation from the centre of the AGB outwards, and show that ˜1-10 per cent of the ejected envelope remains bound to the remnant binary system. We suggest that due to angular momentum conservation and further interaction with the binary system, the fall-back material forms a circumbinary disc around the post-AGB Core and the companion WD. The interaction of the circumbinary disc with the binary system will reduce the orbital separation much more than expected of the dynamical phase (where the envelope is ejected) of the CE alone. The smaller orbital separation favours a merger at the end of the CE phase or a short time after, while the core is still hot. This is another channel for the formation of a massive WD with super-Chandrasekhar mass that might explode as a Type Ia supernova. We term this the core-degenerate (CD) scenario.},

@article{Chabrier:2003,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

@article{Bell:2001,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form Mbaryon~V3.5 (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

	Abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Omega*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

@article{Bours:2013,
	Abstract = {Context. There is general agreement that supernovae Ia correspond to the thermonuclear runaway of a white dwarf that is part of a compact binary, but the details of the progenitor systems are still unknown and much debated. One of the proposed progenitor theories is the single-degenerate channel in which a white dwarf accretes from a companion, grows in mass, reaches a critical mass limit, and is then consumed after thermonuclear runaway sets in. However, there are major disagreements about the theoretical delay time distribution and the corresponding time-integrated supernova Ia rate from this channel.  Aims: We investigate whether the differences are due to the uncertainty in the common envelope phase and the fraction of transferred mass that is retained by the white dwarf. This so-called retention efficiency may have a strong influence on the final amount and timing of supernovae Ia.  Methods: Using the population synthesis code SeBa, we simulated large numbers of binaries for various assumptions on common envelopes and retention efficiencies. We compare the resulting supernova Ia rates and delay time distributions with each other and with those from the literature, including observational data.  Results: For the three assumed retention efficiencies, the integrated rate varies by a factor 3-4 to even more than a factor 100, so in extreme cases, the retention efficiency strongly suppresses the single-degenerate channel. Our different assumptions for the common envelope phase change the integrated rate by a factor 2-3. Although our results do recover the trend in the theoretical predictions from different binary population synthesis codes, they do not fully explain the large disagreement among them.},

	Abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M &sun; are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LambdaCDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey with LRIS-B on Keck of more than 280 star-forming galaxies and AGNs at redshifts 1.4<~z<~3.0 in the GOODS-N field. Candidates are selected by their UnGR colors using the ``BM/BX'' criteria to target redshift 1.4<~z<~2.5 galaxies and the LBG criteria to target redshift z~3 galaxies; combined these samples account for ~25%-30% of the R and Ks band counts to R=25.5 and Ks(AB)=24.4, respectively. The 212 BM/BX galaxies and 74 LBGs constitute the largest spectroscopic sample of galaxies at z>1.4 in GOODS-N. Extensive multiwavelength data allow us to investigate the stellar populations, stellar masses, bolometric luminosities (Lbol), and extinction of z~2 galaxies. Deep Chandra and Spitzer data indicate that the sample includes galaxies with a wide range in Lbol (~=1010 to >1012 Lsolar) and 4 orders of magnitude in dust obscuration (Lbol/LUV). The sample includes galaxies with a large dynamic range in evolutionary state, from very young galaxies (ages ~=50 Myr) with small stellar masses (M*~=109 Msolar) to evolved galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the most massive galaxies at these redshifts (M*>1011 Msolar). Spitzer data indicate that the optical sample includes some fraction of the obscured AGN population at high redshifts: at least 3 of 11 AGNs in the z>1.4 sample are undetected in the deep X-ray data but exhibit power-law SEDs longward of ~2 mum (rest frame) indicative of obscured AGNs. The results of our survey indicate that rest-frame UV selection and spectroscopy presently constitute the most timewise efficient method of culling large samples of high-redshift galaxies with a wide range in intrinsic properties, and the data presented here will add significantly to the multiwavelength legacy of GOODS.  Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

	Abstract = {We report the results of an extensive imaging and spectroscopic survey in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-North field completed using DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope. Observations of 2018 targets in a magnitude-limited sample of 2911 objects to RAB=24.4 yield secure redshifts for a sample of 1440 galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) plus 96 stars. In addition to redshifts and associated quality assessments, our catalog also includes photometric and astrometric measurements for all targets detected in our R-band imaging survey of the GOODS-North region. We investigate various sources of incompleteness and find the redshift catalog to be 53% complete at its limiting magnitude. The median redshift of z=0.65 is lower than in similar deep surveys because we did not select against low-redshift targets. Comparison with other redshift surveys in the same field, including a complementary Hawaii-led DEIMOS survey, establishes that our velocity uncertainties are as low as sigma~40 km s-1 for red galaxies and that our redshift confidence assessments are accurate. The distributions of rest-frame magnitudes and colors among the sample agree well with model predictions out to and beyond z=1. We will release all survey data, including extracted one-dimensional and sky-subtracted two-dimensional spectra, thus providing a sizable and homogeneous database for the GOODS-North field, which will enable studies of large-scale structure, spectral indices, internal galaxy kinematics, and the predictive capabilities of photometric redshifts.  Based in part on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

	Abstract = {We analyze the evolution of the fundamental plane for 141 field spheroidal galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.2, selected morphologically to a magnitude limit F850LP=22.43 in the northern field of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. For massive galaxies, we find that the bulk of the star formation was completed prior to z=2. However, for the lower mass galaxies, the luminosity-weighted ages are significantly younger. The differential change in mass-to-light ratio correlates closely with rest-frame color, consistent with recent star formation and associated growth. Our data are consistent with mass rather than environment governing the overall growth, contrary to the expectations of hierarchical assembly. We discuss how feedback, conduction, and galaxy interactions may explain the downsizing trends seen within our large sample.},

@article{Cohen:2000,
	Abstract = {A redshift survey has been carried out in the region of the Hubble Deep Field North using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) at the Keck Observatory. The resulting redshift catalog, which contains 671 entries, is a compendium of our own data together with published LRIS/Keck data. It is more than 92% complete for objects, irrespective of morphology, to R=24 mag in the HDF itself and to R=23 mag in the flanking fields within a diameter of 8' centered on the HDF, an unusually high completion for a magnitude-limited survey performed with a large telescope. A median redshift z=1.0 is reached at R~23.8. Strong peaks in the redshift distribution, which arise when a group or poor cluster of galaxies intersect the area surveyed, can be identified to z~1.2 in this data set. More than 68% of the galaxies are members of these redshift peaks. In a few cases, closely spaced peaks in z can be resolved into separate groups of galaxies that can be distinguished in both velocity and location on the sky. The radial separation of these peaks in the pencil-beam survey is consistent with a characteristic length scale for the their separation of ~70 Mpc in our adopted cosmology (h=0.6, OmegaM=0.3, Lambda=0). Strong galaxy clustering is in evidence at all epochs back to z<=1.1. A near-infrared selected sample with K<20 was also constructed in this field. Extremely red objects with R-K>5.0 comprise 7% of the total K-selected sample. This fraction rises rapidly toward fainter K magnitude, reaching about 10% at K~19.7. We have attempted to identify the radio sources in the region of the HDF. The secure radio sources seem to divide into two classes. The first have reasonably bright galaxies at moderate redshifts as optical counterparts, while the second, comprising about 1/3 of the total, have extremely faint optical counterparts (R>=25 mag). These do not represent a continuous extrapolation in any property (z or dust content) of the first group. We identify ~2/3 of the secure mid-IR sources in the region of the HDF with normal galaxies with z<1.3. The ratio of the mid-IR to optical flux increases as z increases, but this is due primarily to selection effects, and the same trend is seen in the radio sources. We suggest that the mid-IR emission is more tightly coupled to the rate of ongoing star formation than is the radio emission. We also demonstrate that the best photometric redshift techniques are capable of reaching a precision of sigma[(zphot-zspec)/(1+zspec)]=0.05 for the majority of galaxies with z<1.3. The two broad-lined AGNs with z<3 are the brightest objects in the redshift peak at z~0.96. Based in large part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California.},

@article{Dahlen:2013,
	Abstract = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

	Abstract = {We present the EROS nearby supernova (z ~ 0.02-0.2) search and the analysis of the first year of data (1997). A total of 80 square degrees were surveyed. Eight supernovae were detected, four of which were spectroscopically identified as type Ia supernovae. The search efficiency was determined with a Monte-Carlo simulation taking into account the efficiencies for both supernova detection and host galaxy identification. Assuming that for a given galaxy the supernova rate is proportional to the galactic luminosity, we compute a type Ia supernova explosion rate of: R = 0.44-0.21+0.35 -0.07+0.13 h2 \: / 1010 lsunB/100 yrs at an average redshift of ~ 0.1 where the errors are respectively statistical and systematic (type misidentification included). This work is based on observations made at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.},

@article{Salzano:2013,
	Abstract = {Aims: We investigated the degree of improvement in dark energy constraints that can be achieved by extending Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples to redshifts z > 1.5 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), particularly in the ongoing Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) multi-cycle treasury programs.  Methods: Using the popular Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy w = w0 + wa(1 - a) we generated mock SN Ia samples that can be projected out to higher redshifts. The synthetic datasets thus generated were fitted to the CPL model, and we evaluated the improvements that a high-z sample can add to improve the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters.  Results: In an optimistic but still very achievable scenario, we find that extending the HST sample beyond CANDELS+CLASH to reach a total of 28 SN Ia at z > 1.0 could improve the uncertainty in the wa parameter sigmawaby up to 21%. The corresponding improvement in the figure of merit (FoM) would be as high as 28%. Finally, we consider the use of high-redshift SN Ia samples to detect non-cosmological evolution in SN Ia luminosities with redshift, finding that these tests could be undertaken by future space-based infrared surveys using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).},

	Abstract = {We present a table of redshifts for 2907 galaxies and stars in the 145 arcmin2 HST ACS GOODS-North, making this the most spectroscopically complete redshift sample obtained to date in a field of this size. We also include the redshifts, where available, in a table containing just under 7000 galaxies from the ACS area with Ks,AB<24.5 measured from a deep Ks image obtained with WIRCam on the CFHT, as well as in a table containing 1016 sources with NUVAB<25 and 478 sources with FUVAB<25.5 (there is considerable overlap) measured from the deep GALEX images in the ACS area. Finally, we include the redshifts, where available, in a table containing the 1199 24 mum sources to 80 muJy measured from the wider area  Spitzer GOODS-North. The redshift identifications are greater than 90% complete to magnitudes of F435WAB=24.5, F850LPAB=23.3, and Ks,AB=21.5, and to 24 mum fluxes of 250 muJy. An extensive analysis of these data appear in a companion paper, but here we test the efficiency of color-selection techniques to identify populations of high-redshift galaxies and active galactic nuclei. We also examine the feasibility of doing tomography of the intergalactic medium with a 30 m telescope.  Based in part on data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {The Extended Groth Strip (EGS) is one of the premier fields for extragalactic deep surveys. Deep observations of the EGS with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope cover an area of 0.38 deg2 to a 50% completeness limit of 1.5 muJy at 3.6 mum. The catalog comprises 57,434 objects detected at 3.6 mum, with 84%, 28%, and 24% also detected at 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mum, respectively. Number counts are consistent with results from other Spitzer surveys. Color distributions show that the EGS IRAC sources comprise a mixture of populations: low-redshift star-forming galaxies, quiescent galaxies dominated by stellar emission at a range of redshifts, and high-redshift galaxies and AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We present an IRAC 3.6+4.5 mum selected catalog in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) containing photometry from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared and stellar parameters derived from the analysis of the multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we describe the method used to build coherent spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all the sources. In a forthcoming companion paper, we analyze those SEDs to obtain robust estimations of stellar parameters such as photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates. The catalog comprises 76,936 sources with [3.6] <= 23.75 mag (85% completeness level of the IRAC survey in the EGS) over 0.48 deg2. For approximately 16% of this sample, we are able to deconvolve the IRAC data to obtain robust fluxes for the multiple counterparts found in ground-based optical images. Typically, the SEDs of the IRAC sources in our catalog count with more than 15 photometric data points, spanning from the ultraviolet wavelengths probed by GALEX to the far-infrared observed by Spitzer, and going through ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared data taken with 2-8 m class telescopes. Approximately 95% and 90% of all IRAC sources are detected in the deepest optical and near-infrared bands. These fractions are reduced to 85% and 70% for S/N > 5 detections in each band. Only 10% of the sources in the catalog have optical spectroscopy and redshift estimations. Almost 20% and 2% of the sources are detected by MIPS at 24 and 70 mum, respectively. We also cross-correlate our catalog with public X-ray and radio catalogs. Finally, we present the Rainbow Navigator public Web interface utility, designed to browse all the data products resulting from this work, including images, spectra, photometry, and stellar parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of a Type Ia supernova (SN) at redshift z = 1.914 from the CANDELS multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This SN was discovered in the infrared using the Wide-Field Camera 3, and it is the highest-redshift Type Ia SN yet observed. We classify this object as a SN Ia by comparing its light curve and spectrum with those of a large sample of Type Ia and core-collapse SNe. Its apparent magnitude is consistent with that expected from the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology. We discuss the use of spectral evidence for classification of z > 1.5 SNe Ia using HST grism simulations, finding that spectral data alone can frequently rule out SNe II, but distinguishing between SNe Ia and SNe Ib/c can require prohibitively long exposures. In such cases, a quantitative analysis of the light curve may be necessary for classification. Our photometric and spectroscopic classification methods can aid the determination of SN rates and cosmological parameters from the full high-redshift CANDELS SN sample.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We present the full data set of the spectroscopic campaign of the ESO/GOODS program in the GOODS-South field, obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph at the ESO/VLT.  Methods: Objects were selected as candidates for VLT/FORS2 observations primarily based on the expectation that the detection and measurement of their spectral features would benefit from the high throughput and spectral resolution of FORS2. The reliability of the redshift estimates is assessed using the redshift-magnitude and color-redshift diagrams, and comparing the results with public data.  Results: Including the third part of the spectroscopic campaign (12 masks) to the previous work (26 masks, Vanzella et al. 2005, 2006), 1715 spectra of 1225 individual targets have been analyzed. The actual spectroscopic catalog provides 887 redshift determinations. The typical redshift uncertainty is estimated to be sigmaz ~= 0.001. Galaxies have been selected adopting different color criteria and using photometric redshifts. The resulting redshift distribution typically spans two domains: from z = 0.5 to 2 and z = 3.5 to 6.3.

@article{Mignoli:2005,
	Abstract = {The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the Chandra Deep Field South and the field around the quasar 0055{-}2659, for a total area of 52 arcmin^2. The total K_s-selected sample includes 545 objects. Low-resolution (R ≈ 300{-}600) optical spectra for 525 of them have been obtained with the FORS1/FORS2 spectrographs at the ESO/VLT, providing 501 spectroscopic identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars); consequently, we were able to measure redshifts and identify stars in 96% of the observed objects, whereas the spectroscopic completeness with respect to the total photometrically selected sample is 92% (501/545). The K20 survey is therefore the most complete spectroscopic survey of a near infrared-selected sample to date. The K20 survey contains 444 spectroscopically identified galaxies, covering a redshift range of 0.05 < z < 2.73, with a mean redshift < z>=0.75; excluding the 32 ``low-quality'' redshifts does not significantly change these values. This paper describes the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main emission lines ([OII]lambda3727 and Halpha+[NII]) and two continuum indices (the 4000 {\AA} break index, D4000, and a near-UV color index, ). We defined three main spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The full spectroscopic catalogue, the reduced individual spectra and the composite spectra are released to the community through the K20 web page (http://www.arcetri.astro.it/ k20/). The blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with redshift. The early-type average spectra are remarkable in their similarity, showing only subtle but systematic differences in the D4000 index, which are consistent with the ageing of the stellar population. Conversely, the star-forming galaxies present a significant ``blueing'' of the optical/near-UV continuum with redshift, although the [OII] equivalent width remains constant ( 33 {\AA}) in the same redshift intervals. We reproduce the observed properties with simple, dust-free population synthesis models, suggesting that the high-redshift galaxies are younger and more active than those detected at lower redshift, whilst the equivalent width of the emission lines apparently require a lower metallicity for the low-redshift objects. This may be consistent with the metallicity-luminosity relationship locally observed for star-forming galaxies.},

@article{Balestra:2010,
	Abstract = {Context. We present the full data set of the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) spectroscopic campaign of the ESO/GOODS program in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS), which complements the FORS2 ESO/GOODS spectroscopic campaign.  Aims: The ESO/GOODS spectroscopic programs are aimed at reaching signal-to-noise ratios adequate to measure redshifts for galaxies with AB magnitudes in the range ~24-25 in the B and R band using VIMOS, and in the z band using FORS2.  Methods: The GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic campaign is structured in two separate surveys using two different VIMOS grisms. The VIMOS Low Resolution Blue (LR-Blue) and Medium Resolution (MR) orange grisms have been used to cover different redshift ranges. The LR-Blue campaign is aimed at observing galaxies mainly at 1.8 < z < 3.5, while the MR campaign mainly aims at galaxies at z < 1 and Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z > 3.5.  Results: The full GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic campaign consists of 20 VIMOS masks. This release adds 8 new masks to the previous release (12 masks, Popesso et al. 2009, A&A, 494, 443). In total we obtained 5052 spectra, 3634 from the 10 LR-Blue masks and 1418 from the 10 MR masks. A significant fraction of the extracted spectra comes from serendipitously observed sources: ~21% in the LR-Blue and ~16% in the MR masks. We obtained 2242 redshifts in the LR-Blue campaign and 976 in the MR campaign for a total success rate of 62% and 69% respectively, which increases to 66% and 73% if only primary targets are considered. The typical redshift uncertainty is estimated to be sigmaz ~= 0.00084 (~255 km s-1) for the LR-Blue grism and sigmaz ~= 0.00040 (~120 km s-1) for the MR grism. By complementing our VIMOS spectroscopic catalog with all existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the CDFS, we compiled a redshift master catalog with 7332 entries, which we used to investigate large scale structures out to z ~= 3.7. We produced stacked spectra of LBGs in a few bins of equivalent width (EW) of the Ly-alpha and found evidence for a lack of bright LBGs with high EW of the Ly-alpha. Finally, we obtained new redshifts for 12 X-ray sources of the CDFS and extended-CDFS.  Conclusions: After the completion of the two complementary ESO/GOODS spectroscopic campaigns with VIMOS and FORS2 at VLT, the number of spectroscopic redshifts in CDFS/GOODS field increased dramatically, in particular at z ⪆ 2. These data provide the redshift information indispensable to achieve the scientific goals of GOODS, such as tracing the evolution of galaxy masses, morphologies, clustering, and star formation.

	Abstract = {Aims: We present the first results from the VIsible Multiobject Spectrograph (VIMOS) ESO/GOODS program of spectroscopy for faint galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S). This program complements the FORS2 ESO/GOODS campaign.  Methods: All 3312 spectra were obtained in service mode with VIMOS at the ESO/VLT UT3. The VIMOS LR-Blue and MR grisms were used to cover different redshift ranges. Galaxies at 1.8 < z < 3.5 were observed in the GOODS VIMOS-LR-Blue campaign. Galaxies at z < 1 and Lyman Break Galaxies at z > 3.5 were observed in the VIMOS MR survey.  Results: Here we report results for the first 12 masks (out of 20 total). We extracted 2344 from 6 LR-Blue masks and 968 from 6 MR masks. A large percentage, 33% of the LR-Blue and 18% of the MR spectra, are serendipitous observations. We obtained 1481 and 656 redshifts in the LR-Blue and MR campaign, respectively, for a total success rate of 70% and 75%, respectively, which decrease to 63% and 68% when also the serendipitous targets are considered. The typical redshift accuracy is sigmaz = 0.001. The reliability of the redshift estimate varies with the quality flag. The LR-Blue quality flag A redshifts are reliable at ~95% confidence level, flag B redshifs at ~70% and quality C et ~40%. The MR redshift reliability is somewhat higher: 100% for quality flag A, ~90% for quality flag B and ~70% for flag C. By complementing our VIMOS spectroscopic catalog with all existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the CDF-S, we created a redshift master catalog. By comparing this redshift compilation with different photometric redshift catalogs we estimate the completeness level of the CDF-S spectroscopic coverage in several redshift bins.  Conclusions: The completeness level is very high, >60%, at z < 3.5, and it is very uncertain at higher redshift. The master catalog was used also to estimate completeness and contamination levels of different galaxy photometric selection techniques. The BzK selection method leads to a ~86% complete sample of z > 1.4 galaxies at iAB < 25 mag and with a contamination ~23% of lower redshift objects. The so-called ``sub''-U-dropout and the U-dropout methods lead to an 80% complete galaxy sample at z > 1.4 and iAB < 25 mag, with ~24% low redshift contaminants.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey around the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). We have measured 1599 new redshifts with VIMOS on the European Observatory Very Large Telescope - UT3, in an area 21 × 21.6 arcmin2, including 784 redshifts in the Hubble Space Telescope - Advanced Camera for Surveys GOODS area. 30% of all objects with IAB=24 have been observed independently of magnitude, indicating that the sample is purely magnitude limited. We have reached an unprecedented completeness level of 84% in terms of the ratio of secure measurements vs. observed objects, while 95% of all objects have a redshift measurement. A total of 1452 galaxies, 139 stars, 8 QSOs have a redshift identification, 141 of these being unsecure measurements. The redshift distribution down to IAB=24 is peaked at a median redshift z=0.73, with a significant high redshift tail extending up to ˜4. Several high density peaks in the distribution of galaxies are identified. In particular, the strong peak at z=0.735 contains more than 130 galaxies in a velocity range $\pm$2000 km s-1 distributed all across the transverse ˜20 h-1 Mpc of the survey. We are releasing all redshifts to the community, along with the cross identification with HST-ACS GOODS sources on the CENCOS database environment http://cencosw.oamp.fr.  The data presented in this paper has been obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile.},

@article{Lilly:2009,
	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic redshifts of a large sample of galaxies with I AB < 22.5 in the COSMOS field, measured from spectra of 10,644 objects that have been obtained in the first two years of observations in the zCOSMOS-bright redshift survey. These include a statistically complete subset of 10,109 objects. The average accuracy of individual redshifts is 110 km s-1, independent of redshift. The reliability of individual redshifts is described by a Confidence Class that has been empirically calibrated through repeat spectroscopic observations of over 600 galaxies. There is very good agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the most secure Confidence Classes. For the less secure Confidence Classes, there is a good correspondence between the fraction of objects with a consistent photometric redshift and the spectroscopic repeatability, suggesting that the photometric redshifts can be used to indicate which of the less secure spectroscopic redshifts are likely right and which are probably wrong, and to give an indication of the nature of objects for which we failed to determine a redshift. Using this approach, we can construct a spectroscopic sample that is 99% reliable and which is 88% complete in the sample as a whole, and 95% complete in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 0.8. The luminosity and mass completeness levels of the zCOSMOS-bright sample of galaxies is also discussed.

	Abstract = {We present optical spectroscopy for an X-ray and optical flux-limited sample of 677 XMM-Newton selected targets covering the 2 deg2 Cosmic Evolution Survey field, with a yield of 485 high-confidence redshifts. The majority of the spectra were obtained over three seasons (2005-2007) with the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph instrument on the Magellan (Baade) telescope. We also include in the sample previously published Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra and supplemental observations with MMT/Hectospec. We detail the observations and classification analyses. The survey is 90% complete to flux limits of f 0.5-10 keV  > 8 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 and i + AB < 22, where over 90% of targets have high-confidence redshifts. Making simple corrections for incompleteness due to redshift and spectral type allows for a description of the complete population to i + AB < 23. The corrected sample includes a 57% broad emission line (Type 1, unobscured) active galactic nucleus (AGN) at 0.13 < z < 4.26, 25% narrow emission line (Type 2, obscured) AGN at 0.07 < z < 1.29, and 18% absorption line (host-dominated, obscured) AGN at 0 < z < 1.22 (excluding the stars that made up 4% of the X-ray targets). We show that the survey's limits in X-ray and optical fluxes include nearly all X-ray AGNs (defined by L 0.5-10 keV  > 3 × 1042 erg s-1) to z < 1, of both optically obscured and unobscured types. We find statistically significant evidence that the obscured-to-unobscured AGN ratio at z < 1 increases with redshift and decreases with luminosity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555; the XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA; the Magellan Telescope, which is operated by the Carnegie Observatories; and the MMT, operated by the MMT Observatory, a joint venture of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the effectiveness of two techniques for using X-rays to evaluate the amount of charge diffusion in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). We quantify the degree of charge diffusion with two parameters: sigmad, the standard deviation for a Gaussian diffusion model, and Q, a ratio of the point-spread function (PSF) peak to its wings. The parameters sigmad and Q are determined by fitting a model to a pixel energy histogram and by summing the PSF of all X-ray events, respectively. Using seven test devices, we investigate the precision of these two techniques and demonstrate that they produce compatible results. The histogram-fitting method is sensitive to the structure of the electric field within these devices, in addition to the inherent charge diffusion properties. The Q-ratio is a very simple parameter to measure, and it provides an easily accessible method for quickly evaluating a CCD's diffusion length.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 485 photometrically identified Type Ia supernova candidates mined from the first three years of data of the CFHT SuperNova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The images were submitted to a deferred processing independent of the SNLS real-time detection pipeline. Light curves of all transient events were reconstructed in the gM, rM, iM and zM filters and submitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possible supernovae. Pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by light curve shape criteria. Type Ia supernova identification relied on event characteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normal SNe Ia. The light curve fitter SALT2 was used for this purpose, assigning host galaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. The selected sample of 485 candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the SNLS spectroscopic identification. The contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated to be 4%. Testing Hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us to measure the Malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. The result is fully consistent with the precise Monte Carlo based estimate used to correct SN Ia distance moduli in the SNLS 3-year cosmological analyses. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshift supernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects for cosmological analyses from future large photometric SN Ia surveys.},

	Abstract = {We use three years of data from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) to study the general properties of core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. This is the first such study using the ``rolling search'' technique which guarantees well-sampled SNLS light curves and good efficiency for supernovae brighter than i'~24. Using host photometric redshifts, we measure the supernova absolute magnitude distribution down to luminosities 4.5 mag fainter than normal SNIa. Using spectroscopy and light-curve fitting to discriminate against SNIa, we find a sample of 117 core-collapse supernova candidates with redshifts z < 0.4 (median redshift of 0.29) and measure their rate to be larger than the type Ia supernova rate by a factor 4.5$\pm$0.8(stat.)$\pm$0.6 (sys.). This corresponds to a core-collapse rate at z = 0.3 of [ 1.42$\pm$0.3(stat.)$\pm$0.3(sys.)] ×10-4 yr-1(h_70-1 Mpc)-3.},

	Abstract = {We describe a general analysis package for supernova (SN) light curves, called SNANA, that contains a simulation, a light-curve fitter, and a cosmology fitter. The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as distance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it can also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate contamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. We give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its limitations.},

@article{Smartt:2009,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a 10.5-yr, volume-limited (28-Mpc) search for supernova (SN) progenitor stars. In doing so we compile all SNe discovered within this volume (132, of which 27 per cent are Type Ia) and determine the relative rates of each subtype from literature studies. The core-collapse SNe break down into 59 per cent II-P and 29 per cent Ib/c, with the remainder being IIb (5 per cent), IIn (4 per cent) and II-L (3 per cent). There have been 20 II-P SNe with high-quality optical or near-infrared pre-explosion images that allow a meaningful search for the progenitor stars. In five cases they are clearly red supergiants, one case is unconstrained, two fall on compact coeval star clusters and the other twelve have no progenitor detected. We review and update all the available data for the host galaxies and SN environments (distance, metallicity and extinction) and determine masses and upper mass estimates for these 20 progenitor stars using the STARS stellar evolutionary code and a single consistent homogeneous method. A maximum likelihood calculation suggests that the minimum stellar mass for a Type II-P to form is mmin = 8.5+1-1.5Msolar and the maximum mass for II-P progenitors is mmax = 16.5 +/- 1.5Msolar, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function holds for the progenitor population (in the range Gamma = -1.35+0.3-0.7). The minimum mass is consistent with current estimates for the upper limit to white dwarf progenitor masses, but the maximum mass does not appear consistent with massive star populations in Local Group galaxies. Red supergiants in the Local Group have masses up to 25Msolar and the minimum mass to produce a Wolf-Rayet star in single star evolution (between solar and LMC metallicity) is similarly 25-30Msolar. The reason we have not detected any high-mass red supergiant progenitors above 17Msolar is unclear, but we estimate that it is statistically significant at 2.4sigma confidence. Two simple reasons for this could be that we have systematically underestimated the progenitor masses due to dust extinction or that stars between 17-25Msolar produce other kinds of SNe which are not II-P. We discuss these possibilities and find that neither provides a satisfactory solution. We term this discrepancy the `red supergiant problem' and speculate that these stars could have core masses high enough to form black holes and SNe which are too faint to have been detected. We compare the 56Ni masses ejected in the SNe to the progenitor mass estimates and find that low-luminosity SNe with low 56Ni production are most likely to arise from explosions of low-mass progenitors near the mass threshold that can produce a core-collapse.},

	Abstract = {We employ 76 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with optical spectrophotometry within 2.5 days of B-band maximum light obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory to derive the impact of Si and Ca features on the supernovae intrinsic luminosity and determine a dust reddening law. We use the equivalent width of Si ii lambda4131 in place of the light curve stretch to account for first-order intrinsic luminosity variability. The resulting empirical spectral reddening law exhibits strong features that are associated with Ca ii and Si ii lambda6355. After applying a correction based on the Ca ii H&K equivalent width we find a reddening law consistent with a Cardelli extinction law. Using the same input data, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame UBVRI-like photometry to mimic literature observations. After corrections for signatures correlated with Si ii lambda4131 and Ca ii H&K equivalent widths and introducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dust component in each band. We find a value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, RV = 2.8 $\pm$ 0.3. This agrees with the Milky Way value, in contrast to the low RV values found in most previous analyses. This result suggests that the long-standing controversy in interpreting SN Ia colors and their compatibility with a classical extinction law, which is critical to their use as cosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion in colors, and by the variability of features apparent in SN Ia spectra.

@article{Marriner:2011,
	Abstract = {We describe a new formalism to fit the parameters alpha and beta that are used in the SALT2 model to determine the standard magnitudes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new formalism describes the intrinsic scatter in SNe Ia by a covariance matrix in place of the single parameter normally used. We have applied this formalism to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Supernova Survey (SDSS-II) data and conclude that the data are best described by alpha = 0.135+.033 -.017 and beta = 3.19+0.14 - 0.24, where the error is dominated by the uncertainty in the form of the intrinsic scatter matrix. Our result depends on the introduction of a more general form for the intrinsic scatter of the distance moduli of SNe Ia than is conventional, resulting in a larger value of beta and a larger uncertainty than the conventional approach. Although this analysis results in a larger value of beta and a larger error, the SDSS data differ (at a 98% confidence level) from beta = 4.1, the value expected for extinction by the type of dust found in the Milky Way. We have modeled the distribution of SNe Ia in terms of their color and conclude that there is strong evidence that variation in color is a significant contributor to the scatter of SNe Ia around their standard candle magnitude.},

We give examples of determining the rates of gravitational-wave events in the presence of background triggers from a template bank when noise parameters are known and/or can be fit from the trigger data. We also give an example of determining globular-cluster shape, location, and density from an observation of a stellar field that contains a non-uniform background density of stars superimposed on the cluster stars.},

	Abstract = {While the high-z frontier of star formation rate (SFR) studies has advanced rapidly, direct measurements beyond z~4 remain difficult, as shown by significant disagreements among different results. Gamma-ray bursts, owing to their brightness and association with massive stars, offer hope of clarifying this situation, provided that the GRB rate can be properly related to the SFR. The Swift GRB data reveal an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the SFR at intermediate z; taking this into account, we use the highest-z GRB data to make a new determination of the SFR at z=4-7. Our results exceed the lowest direct SFR measurements and imply that no steep drop exists in the SFR up to at least z~6.5. We discuss the implications of our result for cosmic reionization, the efficiency of the universe in producing stellar-mass black holes, and ``GRB feedback'' in star-forming hosts.},

	Abstract = {We identify a "supernova rate problem:" the measured cosmic core-collapse supernova rate is a factor of ~2 smaller (with significance ~2sigma) than that predicted from the measured cosmic massive-star formation rate. The comparison is critical for topics from galaxy evolution and enrichment to the abundance of neutron stars and black holes. We systematically explore possible resolutions. The accuracy and precision of the star formation rate data and conversion to the supernova rate are well supported, and proposed changes would have far-reaching consequences. The dominant effect is likely that many supernovae are missed because they are either optically dim (low-luminosity) or dark, whether intrinsically or due to obscuration. We investigate supernovae too dim to have been discovered in cosmic surveys by a detailed study of all supernova discoveries in the local volume. If possible supernova impostors are included, then dim supernovae are common enough by fraction to solve the supernova rate problem. If they are not included, then the rate of dark core collapses is likely substantial. Other alternatives are that there are surprising changes in our understanding of star formation or supernova rates, including that supernovae form differently in small galaxies than in normal galaxies. These possibilities can be distinguished by upcoming supernova surveys, star formation measurements, searches for disappearing massive stars, and measurements of supernova neutrinos.},

	Abstract = {Using reconstructed galaxy star formation histories, we calculate the instantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formation rate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from z = 8 to the present day. This efficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 1011.7 M &sun;, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the mass scale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. Above the characteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z = 4. We show that a time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of the cosmic star formation rate since z = 4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates. The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z = 2 is especially sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The core collapse supernova rate provides a strong lower limit for the star formation rate (SFR). Progress in using it as a cosmic SFR tracer requires some confidence that it is consistent with more conventional SFR diagnostics in the nearby Universe. This paper compares standard SFR measurements based on Halpha, far ultraviolet (FUV) and total infrared (TIR) galaxy luminosities with the observed core collapse supernova rate in the same galaxy sample. The comparison can be viewed from two perspectives. Firstly, by adopting an estimate of the minimum stellar mass to produce a core collapse supernova one can determine a SFR from supernova numbers. Secondly, the radiative SFR can be assumed to be robust and then the supernova statistics provide a constrain on the minimum stellar mass for core collapse supernova progenitors.  Methods: The novel aspect of this study is that Halpha, FUV and TIR luminosities are now available for a complete galaxy sample within the local 11 Mpc volume and the number of discovered supernovae in this sample within the last 13 years is high enough to perform a meaningful statistical comparison. We exploit the multi-wavelength dataset from 11 HUGS, a volume-limited survey designed to provide a census of SFR in the Local Volume. There are 14 supernovae discovered in this sample of galaxies within the last 13 years. Although one could argue that this may not be complete, it is certainly a robust lower limit.  Results: Assuming a lower limit for core collapse of 8 M&sun; (as proposed by direct detections of SN progenitor stars and white dwarf progenitors), the core-collapse supernova rate matches the SFR from the FUV luminosity. However, the SFR based on Halpha luminosity is lower than these two estimates by a factor of nearly 2. If we assume that the FUV or Halpha based luminosities are a true reflection of the SFR, we find that the minimum mass for core collapse supernova progenitors is 8 $\pm$ 1 M&sun; and 6 $\pm$ 1 M&sun;, respectively.  Conclusions: The estimate of the minimum mass for core collapse supernova progenitors obtained exploiting FUV data is in good agreement with that from the direct detection of supernova progenitors. The concordant results by these independent methods point toward a constraint of 8 $\pm$ 1 M&sun; on the lower mass limit for progenitor stars of core collapse supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We present supernova rate measurements at redshift 0.1-1.0 from the Stockholm VIMOS Supernova Survey (SVISS). The sample contains 16 supernovae in total. The discovered supernovae have been classified as core collapse or type Ia supernovae (9 and 7, respectively) based on their light curves, colour evolution and host galaxy photometric redshift. The rates we find for the core collapse supernovae are 3.29-1.78 -1.45+3.08 +1.98 × 10-4 yr-1 Mpc-3 h703 (with statistical and systematic errors respectively) at average redshift 0.39 and 6.40-3.12 -2.11+5.30 +3.65 × 10-4 yr-1 Mpc-3 h703 at average redshift 0.73. For the type Ia supernovae we find a rate of 1.29-0.57 -0.28+0.88 +0.27 × 10-4 yr-1 Mpc-3 h703 at  = 0.62. All of these rate estimates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction, using a method that includes supernovae missed in infrared bright galaxies at high redshift. We use Monte Carlo simulations to make a thorough study of the systematic effects from assumptions made when calculating the rates and find that the most important errors come from misclassification, the assumed mix of faint and bright supernova types and uncertainties in the extinction correction. We compare our rates to other observations and to the predicted rates for core collapse and type Ia supernovae based on the star formation history and different models of the delay time distribution. Overall, our measurements, when taking the effects of extinction into account, agree quite well with the predictions and earlier results. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of systematic effects, and dust extinction in particular, when trying to estimate the rates of supernovae at moderate to high redshift.

	Abstract = {The Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) is a 524-orbit Multi-Cycle Treasury Program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25 galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive (kT > 5 keV) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (thetaEin > 35'' at zs = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z > 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise (sigma z ~ 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z > 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae. We present newly re-derived X-ray luminosities, temperatures, and Fe abundances for the CLASH clusters as well as a representative source list for MACS1149.6+2223 (z = 0.544).},

	Abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play an important role in astrophysics and are crucial for the studies of stellar evolution, galaxy evolution and cosmology. They are generally thought to be thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) in close binaries, however, the nature of the mass donor star is still unclear. In this article, we review various progenitor models proposed in the past years and summarize many observational results that can be used to put constraints on the nature of their progenitors. We also discuss the origin of SN Ia diversity and the impacts of SN Ia progenitors on some fields. The currently favourable progenitor model is the single-degenerate (SD) model, in which the WD accretes material from a non-degenerate companion star. This model may explain the similarities of most SNe Ia. It has long been argued that the double-degenerate (DD) model, which involves the merger of two CO WDs, may lead to an accretion-induced collapse rather than a thermonuclear explosion. However, recent observations of a few SNe Ia seem to support the DD model, and this model can produce normal SN Ia explosion under certain conditions. Additionally, the sub-luminous SNe Ia may be explained by the sub-Chandrasekhar mass model. At present, it seems likely that more than one progenitor model, including some variants of the SD and DD models, may be required to explain the observed diversity of SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a redshift 1.71 supernova in the GOODS-North field. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS spectrum has almost negligible contamination from the host or neighboring galaxies. Although the rest-frame-sampled range is too blue to include any Si II line, a principal component analysis allows us to confirm it as a Type Ia supernova with 92% confidence. A recent serendipitous archival HST WFC3 grism spectrum contributed a key element of the confirmation by giving a host-galaxy redshift of 1.713 $\pm$ 0.007. In addition to being the most distant SN Ia with spectroscopic confirmation, this is the most distant Ia with a precision color measurement. We present the ACS WFC and NICMOS 2 photometry and ACS and WFC3 spectroscopy. Our derived supernova distance is in agreement with the prediction of LambdaCDM.

	Abstract = {We estimate the fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that remain undetected by optical SN searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dust in their host galaxies. This effect is especially important in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the star formation at redshifts of z ~ 1-2. We perform a detailed investigation of the SN activity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy Arp 299 and estimate that up to 83% of the SNe in Arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local universe are missed by observations at optical wavelengths. For rest-frame optical surveys we find the fraction of SNe missed due to high dust extinction to increase from the average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z ~ 1.2 and then remain roughly constant up to z ~ 2. It is therefore crucial to take into account the effects of obscuration by dust when determining SN rates at high redshift and when predicting the number of CCSNe detectable by future high-z surveys such as LSST, JWST, and Euclid. For a sample of nearby CCSNe (distances 6-15 Mpc) detected during the last 12 yr, we find a lower limit for the local CCSN rate of 1.5+0.4 - 0.3 × 10-4 yr-1 Mpc-3, consistent with that expected from the star formation rate. Even closer, at distances less than ~6 Mpc, we find a significant increase in the CCSN rate, indicating a local overdensity of star formation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiple SNe.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological inference becomes increasingly difficult when complex data-generating processes cannot be modeled by simple probability distributions. With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology, there is an increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic errors in the model will dominate where previously these were swamped by statistical errors. For example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. Assuming a flat cosmology and constant dark energy equation of state, we demonstrate that ABC can recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally, we show that ABC can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we contaminate the sample with Type IIP supernovae.},

	Abstract = {A novel approach, a Dense Shell Method, is proposed for measuring distances for cosmology. It is based on original Baade idea to relate absolute difference of photospheric radii with photospheric velocity. We demonstrate that this idea works: the new method does not rely on the Cosmic Distance Ladder and gives satisfactory results for the most luminous Type IIn Supernovae. This allows one to make them good primary distance indicators for cosmology. Fixing correction factors for illustration, we obtain with this method the median distance of ≈ 68{-15/+19}(68%CL) Mpc to SN 2006gy and median Hubble parameter 79{-17/+23}(68%CL) km/(s Mpc).},

@article{Karpenka:2013,
	Abstract = {A method is presented for automated photometric classification of supernovae (SNe) as Type Ia or non-Ia. A two-step approach is adopted in which (i) the SN light curve flux measurements in each observing filter are fitted separately to an analytical parametrized function that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate virtually all types of SNe and (ii) the fitted function parameters and their associated uncertainties, along with the number of flux measurements, the maximum-likelihood value of the fit and Bayesian evidence for the model, are used as the input feature vector to a classification neural network that outputs the probability that the SN under consideration is of Type Ia. The method is trained and tested using data released following the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPCC), consisting of light curves for 20 895 SNe in total. We consider several random divisions of the data into training and testing sets: for instance, for our sample D_1 (D_4), a total of 10 (40) per cent of the data are involved in training the algorithm and the remainder used for blind testing of the resulting classifier; we make no selection cuts. Assigning a canonical threshold probability of pth = 0.5 on the network output to class an SN as Type Ia, for the sample D_1 (D_4) we obtain a completeness of 0.78 (0.82), purity of 0.77 (0.82) and SNPCC figure of merit of 0.41 (0.50). Including the SN host-galaxy redshift and its uncertainty as additional inputs to the classification network results in a modest 5-10 per cent increase in these values. We find that the quality of the classification does not vary significantly with SN redshift. Moreover, our probabilistic classification method allows one to calculate the expected completeness, purity and figure of merit (or other measures of classification quality) as a function of the threshold probability pth, without knowing the true classes of the SNe in the testing sample, as is the case in the classification of real SNe data. The method may thus be improved further by optimizing pth and can easily be extended to divide non-Ia SNe into their different classes.},

	Abstract = {We use a sample of 45 core collapse supernovae detected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope to derive the core collapse supernova rate in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.3. In redshift bins centered on langzrang = 0.39, langzrang = 0.73, and langzrang = 1.11, we find rates of 3.00+1.28 - 0.94 +1.04 - 0.57, 7.39+1.86 - 1.52 +3.20 - 1.60, and 9.57+3.76 - 2.80 +4.96 - 2.80, respectively, given in units of yr-1 Mpc-3 10-4 h 3 70. The rates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction, including supernovae missed in highly dust-enshrouded environments in infrared bright galaxies. The first errors are statistical while the second ones are the estimated systematic errors. We perform a detailed discussion of possible sources of systematic errors and note that these start to dominate over statistical errors at z > 0.5, emphasizing the need to better control the systematic effects. For example, a better understanding of the amount of dust extinction in the host galaxies and knowledge of the supernova luminosity function, in particular the fraction of faint M >~ -15 supernovae, is needed to better constrain the rates. When comparing our results with the core collapse supernova rate based on the star formation rate, we find a good agreement, consistent with the supernova rate following the star formation rate, as expected.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the maximum light, near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2900 < lambda < 5500 {\AA}) spectra of 32 low-redshift (0.001 < z < 0.08) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We combine this spectroscopic sample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes to measure SN Ia photometric parameters, such as stretch (light-curve width), optical colour and brightness (Hubble residual). By comparing our new data to a comparable sample of SNe Ia at intermediate redshift (0.4 < z < 0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3sigma), in the sense that our mean low-redshift NUV spectrum has a depressed flux compared to its intermediate-redshift counterpart. We also see a strongly increased dispersion about the mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys. We show that these trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted by contemporary SN Ia spectral models. We also examine the properties of various NUV spectral diagnostics in the individual SN spectra. We find a general correlation between SN stretch and the velocity (or position) of many NUV spectral features. In particular, we observe that higher stretch SNe have larger Ca II H&K velocities, which also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. This latter trend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretch and host galaxy stellar mass. We find no significant trends between UV spectral features and optical colour. Mean spectra constructed according to whether the SN has a positive or negative Hubble residual show very little difference at NUV wavelengths, indicating that the NUV evolution and variation we identify does not directly correlate with Hubble diagram residuals. Our work confirms and strengthens earlier conclusions regarding the complex behaviour of SNe Ia in the NUV spectral region, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constraining progenitor models rather than improving the use of SNe Ia as cosmological probes.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the brightness distribution expected for thermonuclear explosions that might result from the ignition of a detonation during the violent merger of white dwarf (WD) binaries. Violent WD mergers are a subclass of the canonical double degenerate scenario where two carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs merge when the larger WD fills its Roche lobe. Determining their brightness distribution is critical for evaluating whether such an explosion model could be responsible for a significant fraction of the observed population of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We argue that the brightness of an explosion realized via the violent merger model is mainly determined by the mass of 56Ni produced in the detonation of the primary CO WD. To quantify this link, we use a set of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD detonation models to derive a relationship between primary WD mass (mWD) and expected peak bolometric brightness (Mbol). We use this mWD-Mbol relationship to convert the masses of merging primary WDs from binary population models to a predicted distribution of explosion brightness. We also investigate the sensitivity of our results to assumptions about the conditions required to realize a detonation during violent mergers of WDs. We find a striking similarity between the shape of our theoretical peak-magnitude distribution and that observed for SNe Ia: our model produces a Mbol distribution that roughly covers the range and matches the shape of the one observed for SNe Ia. However, this agreement hinges on a particular phase of mass accretion during binary evolution: the primary WD gains ˜0.15-0.35 M&sun; from a slightly evolved helium star companion. In our standard binary evolution model, such an accretion phase is predicted to occur for about 43 per cent of all binary systems that ultimately give rise to binary CO WD mergers. We also find that with high probability, violent WD mergers involving the most massive primaries ( ≳ 1.3 M&sun;, which should produce bright SNe) have delay times ≲ 500 Myr.},

	Abstract = {We report a measurement of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at 0.9 < z < 1.46 from the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey. This is the first cluster SN Ia rate measurement with detected z > 0.9 SNe. Finding 8 $\pm$ 1 cluster SNe Ia, we determine an SN Ia rate of 0.50+0.23 -0.19 (stat) +0.10 -0.09 (sys) h 2 70 SNuB (SNuB ≡ 10-12 SNe L -1 &sun;, B  yr-1). In units of stellar mass, this translates to 0.36+0.16 -0.13 (stat) +0.07 -0.06 (sys) h 2 70 SNuM (SNuM ≡ 10-12 SNe M -1 &sun; yr-1). This represents a factor of ≈5 $\pm$ 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rate at z < 0.2. We parameterize the late-time SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD) with a power law: Psi(t)vpropts . Under the approximation of a single-burst cluster formation redshift of zf = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshift cluster SN Ia rates constrains s = -1.41+0.47 -0.40, consistent with measurements of the DTD in the field. This measurement is generally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario and inconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting a steeper DTD at large delay times. We check for environmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations by calculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and in morphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the full cluster rate. Finally, the upper limit of one hostless cluster SN Ia detected in the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium is less than 0.47 (95% confidence), consistent with measurements at lower redshifts.  Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute. STScI is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program GO-10496.},

	Abstract = {Supernovae, the luminous explosions of stars, have been observed since antiquity. However, various examples of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe; luminosities >7 × 1043 ergs per second) have only recently been documented. From the accumulated evidence, SLSNe can be classified as radioactively powered (SLSN-R), hydrogen-rich (SLSN-II), and hydrogen-poor (SLSN-I, the most luminous class). The SLSN-II and SLSN-I classes are more common, whereas the SLSN-R class is better understood. The physical origins of the extreme luminosity emitted by SLSNe are a focus of current research.},

	Abstract = {A rare class of `superluminous' supernovae that are about ten or more times more luminous at their peaks than other types of luminous supernova has recently been found at low to intermediate redshifts. A small subset of these events have luminosities that evolve slowly and result in radiated energies of up to about 1051ergs. Therefore, they are probably examples of `pair-instability' or `pulsational pair-instability' supernovae with estimated progenitor masses of 100 to 250 times that of the Sun. These events are exceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high redshift because the mass distribution of the earliest stars was probably skewed to high values. Here we report the detection of two superluminous supernovae, at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, that have slowly evolving light curves. We estimate the rate of events at redshifts of 2 and 4 to be approximately ten times higher than the rate at low redshift. The extreme luminosities of superluminous supernovae extend the redshift limit for supernova detection using present technology, previously 2.36 (ref. 8), and provide a way of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang.},

	Abstract = {We present seven spectroscopically confirmed Type II cluster supernovae (SNe II) discovered in the Multi-Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey, a supernova survey targeting 57 low-redshift 0.05 < z < 0.15 galaxy clusters with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We find the rate of Type II supernovae within R 200 of z ~ 0.1 galaxy clusters to be 0.026+0.085 -0.018(stat)+0.003 -0.001(sys) SNuM.  Surprisingly, one SN II is in a red-sequence host galaxy that shows no clear evidence of recent star formation (SF). This is unambiguous evidence in support of ongoing, low-level SF in at least some cluster elliptical galaxies, and illustrates that galaxies that appear to be quiescent cannot be assumed to host only Type Ia SNe. Based on this single SN II we make the first measurement of the SN II rate in red-sequence galaxies, and find it to be 0.007+0.014-0.007(stat) +0.009 -0.001(sys) SNuM. We also make the first derivation of cluster specific star formation rates (sSFR) from cluster SN II rates. We find that for all galaxy types the sSFR is 5.1+15.8 -3.1(stat) $\pm$ 0.9(sys) M &sun; yr-1 (1012 M&sun;)-1, and for red-sequence galaxies only it is 2.0+4.2 -0.9(stat) $\pm$ 0.4(sys) M &sun; yr-1 (1012 M &sun;)-1. These values agree with SFRs measured from infrared and ultraviolet photometry, and Halpha emission from optical spectroscopy. Additionally, we use the SFR derived from our SNII rate to show that although a small fraction of cluster Type Ia SNe may originate in the young stellar population and experience a short delay time, these results do not preclude the use of cluster SN Ia rates to derive the late-time delay time distribution for SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {We have calculated fast direct spectral model fits to two early-time spectra of the Type II plateau SN 1999em, using the SYNOW synthetic spectrum code. The first is an extremely early blue optical spectrum and the second a combined Hubble Space Telescope and optical spectrum obtained one week later. Spectroscopically this supernova appears to be a normal Type II, and these fits are in excellent agreement with the observed spectra. Our direct analysis suggests the presence of enhanced nitrogen. We have further studied these spectra with the full non-LTE general model atmosphere code PHOENIX. While we do not find confirmation for enhanced nitrogen (nor do we rule it out), we do require enhanced helium. An even more intriguing possible line identification is complicated Balmer and He I lines, which we show falls naturally out of the detailed calculations with a shallow density gradient. We also show that very early spectra such as those presented here combined with sophisticated spectral modeling allow an independent estimate of the total reddening to the supernova, since when the spectrum is very blue, dereddening leads to changes in the blue flux that cannot be reproduced by altering the ``temperature'' of the emitted radiation. These results are extremely encouraging since they imply that detailed modeling of early spectra can shed light on both the abundances and total extinction of SNe II, the latter improving their utility and reliability as distance indicators.},

	Abstract = {We report early photospheric-phase observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2005cs obtained by the Swift ultraviolet-optical and X-ray telescopes. Observations started within 2 days of discovery and continued on a regular basis for 3 weeks. During this time the V-band magnitude remained essentially constant, while the UV was initially bright, but steadily faded until below the brightness of an underlying UV-bright H II region. This UV decay is similar to SNe II observed by the International Ultraviolet Explorer. UV grism spectra show the P Cygni absorption of Mg II 2798 {\AA}, indicating a photospheric origin of the UV flux. Based on non-LTE model atmosphere calculations with the CMFGEN code, we associate the rapid evolution of the UV flux with the cooling of the ejecta, the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) shifting from ~700 {\AA} on June 30 to ~1200 {\AA} on July 5. Furthermore, the corresponding recombination of the ejecta, e.g., the transition from Fe III to Fe II, induces a considerable strengthening of metal line-blanketing at and above the photosphere, blocking more and more effectively this fading UV flux. SN 2005cs was not detected in the X-ray band, and the upper limit to the X-ray luminosity yields a limit to the mass-loss rate of the progenitor of M˙<~1×10-5 yr-1 (vw/10 km s-1). Overall, Swift represents a unique opportunity to capture the early and fast evolution of Type II SNe in the UV, providing additional constraints on the reddening, the SED shortward of 4000 {\AA}, and the ionization state and temperature of the photon-decoupling regions.},

	Abstract = {We present ultraviolet (UV) observations of supernovae (SNe) obtained with the UltraViolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board the Swift spacecraft. This is the largest sample of UV light curves from any single instrument and covers all major SN types and most subtypes. The UV light curves of SNe Ia are fairly homogenous, while SNe Ib/c and IIP show more variety in their light-curve shapes. The UV-optical colors clearly differentiate SNe Ia and IIP, particularly at early times. The color evolution of SNe IIP, however, makes their colors similar to SNe Ia at about 20 days after explosion. SNe Ib/c are shown to have varied UV-optical colors. The use of UV colors to help type SNe will be important for high-redshift SNe discovered in optical observations. These data can be added to ground-based optical and near infrared data to create bolometric light curves of individual objects and as checks on generic bolometric corrections used in the absence of UV data. This sample can also be compared with rest-frame UV observations of high-redshift SNe observed at optical wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {We present Keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) through optical spectra of 21 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.11 <= z <= 0.37 and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) SN Survey. Using the broadband photometry of the SDSS survey, we are able to reconstruct the SN host-galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxy contamination in the SN Ia spectra. Comparison of composite spectra constructed from a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from a low-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the Keck/SDSS SNe Ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but show a UV flux excess. This observation is confirmed by comparing synthesized broadband colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in mean colors at the 2.4sigma-4.4sigma level for various UV colors. We further see a slight difference in the UV spectral shape between SNe with low-mass and high-mass host galaxies. Additionally, we detect a relationship between the flux ratio at 2770 and 2900 {\AA} and peak luminosity that differs from that observed at low redshift. We find that changing the UV SED of an SN Ia within the observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag. This effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame UV. We suggest that this discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population of the two SN samples or to small-sample statistics.},

	Abstract = {We present the earliest ultraviolet (UV) observations of the bright Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe/PTF11kly in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of only 6.4 Mpc. It was discovered shortly after explosion by the Palomar Transient Factory and first observed by Swift/UVOT about a day after explosion. The early UV light is well defined, with ~20 data points per filter in the five days after explosion. These early and well-sampled UV observations form new template light curves for comparison with observations of other SNe Ia at low and high redshift. We report fits from semiempirical models of the explosion and find the time evolution of the early UV flux to be well fitted by the superposition of two parabolic curves. Finally, we use the early UV flux measurements to examine a possible shock interaction with a non-degenerate companion. From models predicting the measurable shock emission, we find that even a solar mass companion at a distance of a few solar radii is unlikely at more than 95% confidence.},

	Abstract = {We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy and photometry of four Type Ia supernovae (SNe 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005M, and 2005cf) obtained with the UV prism of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. This data set provides unique spectral time series down to 2000 {\AA}. Significant diversity is seen in the near-maximum-light spectra (~2000-3500 {\AA}) for this small sample. The corresponding photometric data, together with archival data from Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observations, provide further evidence of increased dispersion in the UV emission with respect to the optical. The peak luminosities measured in the uvw1/F250W filter are found to correlate with the B-band light-curve shape parameter Deltam 15(B), but with much larger scatter relative to the correlation in the broadband B band (e.g., ~0.4 mag versus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 mag < Deltam 15(B) < 1.7 mag). SN 2004dt is found as an outlier of this correlation (at > 3sigma), being brighter than normal SNe Ia such as SN 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/F250W and uvm2/F220W filters, respectively. We show that different progenitor metallicity or line-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy. Viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have a significant influence on the flux emitted in the UV region. Detailed modeling is needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.},

	Abstract = {We present the initial results from our GALEX program designed to obtain ultraviolet (UV) spectra of nearby core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our first target, SN 2005ay in the nearby galaxy NGC 3938, is a typical member of the SN II-P subclass. Our spectra show remarkable similarity to those of the prototypical Type II-P SN 1999em, and resemble also Swift observations of the recent Type II-P SN 2005cs. Taken together, the observations of these three events trace the UV spectral evolution of SNe II-P during the first month after explosion, as required in order to interpret optical observations of high-redshift SNe II-P, and to derive cross-filter K-corrections. While still highly preliminary, the apparent UV homogeneity of SNe II-P bodes well for the use of these events as cosmological probes at high redshift.},

	Abstract = {We present the entire sample of ultraviolet (UV) spectra of supernovae (SNe) obtained with the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board the Swift satellite during the first two years of observations (2005/2006). A total of 29 UV-grism and 22 V-grism spectra of nine SNe have been collected, of which six are thermonuclear (Type Ia) and three core-collapse (Type Ibc/II) SNe. All the spectra have been obtained during the photospheric phase. After a comparison of the spectra of our sample with those in the literature (SNe 1992A, 1990N, and 1999em), we confirm some degree of diversity in the UV emission of Type Ia SNe and a greater homogeneity in the Type II Plateau SN sample. Signatures of interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar environment have been found in the UV spectrum of SN 2006jc, the only SN Type Ib/c for which UVOT grism data are available. Currently, Swift UVOT is the best suited instrument for early SN studies in the UV due to its fast response and flexible scheduling capabilities. However, in order to increase the quality of the data and significantly improve our understanding of the UV properties of SNe and to fully maximize the scientific potential of UVOT grism observations, a larger investment in observing time and longer exposures are needed.},

	Abstract = {I systematically investigate the formation of double degenerates (DDs) via binary interactions. I consider three evolutionary channels for their formation [stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) plus common envelope (CE), CE plus CE, exposed core plus CE], and carry out Monte Carlo simulations. I explore the effects of model parameters, such as the tidal-enhancement parameter for stellar wind, the mass transfer efficiency for stable RLOF, and the CE ejection efficiency, on my results. I also explore the effects of various assumptions about age, metallicity, mass ratio distribution and wind velocity. My results show that the model is successful in the explanation of the formation of DDs. I explain satisfactorily the distributions of masses, mass ratios, orbital periods and birth rate of the observed DDs. The main conclusions are the following. (i) Stable RLOF plus CE and CE plus CE are the main evolutionary scenarios leading to the formation of DDs. (ii) The Galactic birth rate of DDs is 0.03yr^-1, and the birth rate of DDs with helium (He) white dwarfs (WDs) as brighter components is 0.017yr^-1. (iii) The number of detectable DDs in our Galaxy is 3x10^6, and DDs with brighter He WDs make up 56 per cent. (iv) The distribution of orbital periods for detectable DDs peaks around 6 h. (v) WD 0957-666 and WD 1101+364 are formed through the stable RLOF plus CE scenario, and WD 0135-052 is possibly a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD pair rather than a helium (He) WD pair. (vi) The Galactic birth rates of close WD binaries and DD mergers are 0.074 and 0.029 yr^-1, respectively. (vii) The mergers of two He WDs and the mergers of He and CO WDs have masses of 0.61+/-0.09 and 0.96+/-0.13Msolar, respectively. (viii) Mass transfer during stable RLOF is not conservative. (ix) A tidally enhanced stellar wind exists. I also investigate the formation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), cataclysmic variables (CVs), subdwarf O-type (sdO) stars and R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) stars. The birth rates of SNe Ia and CVs are successfully explained in the above model. The model also shows that CVs with long orbital periods tend to have CO WDs. The birth rates of the mergers of two He WDs (sdO stars) and the mergers of He and CO WDs (R CrB stars) are 0.006 and 0.018yr^-1 in the Galaxy, respectively. The birth rates of CVs, DDs, DD mergers and SNe Ia are more sensitive to the recent stellar formation history than to the past one.},

The survey includes multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy from X-ray-to-radio wavelengths covering a 2 deg2 area, including HST imaging. Given the very high sensitivity and resolution of these data sets, COSMOS also provides unprecedented samples of objects at high redshift with greatly reduced cosmic variance, compared to earlier surveys. Here we provide a brief overview of the survey strategy, the characteristics of the major COSMOS data sets, and a summary the science goals.

	Abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest {\'e}tendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg2 to a depth of K ~ 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg2 to K ~ 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg2 to K ~ 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

	Abstract = {We present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infrared (near-IR) galaxy luminosity function (LF), derived from the analysis of a new sample of ~22000KAB <= 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 deg2 from the Early Data Release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). Our study has exploited the multiwavelength coverage of the UDS field provided by the new UKIDSS WFCAM K- and J-band imaging, the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey and the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey. The unique combination of large area and depth provided by this new survey minimizes the complicating effect of cosmic variance and has allowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sources out to z ~= 2 with good statistical accuracy.  In agreement with previous studies, we find that the characteristic luminosity of the near-IR LF brightens by ~=1 mag between z = 0 and z ~= 2, while the total density decreases by a factor of ~=2. Using the rest-frame (U - B) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm the classic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z <~ 1. However, the strength of the colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, and seems to disappear by z >~ 1.5. Due to the large size of our sample, we are able to investigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxy populations. It is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies (MK <= - 23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sources dominate the bright end of the LF at redshifts z <~ 1. In contrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease in space density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominate the bright end of the LF at redshifts z >~ 1.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate in galaxy clusters based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. The cluster SN Ia rate is determined from 9 SN events in a set of 71 C4 clusters at z <= 0.17 and 27 SN events in 492 maxBCG clusters at 0.1 <= z <= 0.3. We find values for the cluster SN Ia rate of (0.37+0.17+0.01 -0.12-0.01) SNur h 2 and (0.55+0.13+0.02 -0.11-0.01) SNur h 2 (SNux = 10-12 L -1  xsun yr-1) in C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively, where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. The SN rate for early-type galaxies is found to be (0.31+0.18+0.01 -0.12-0.01) SNur h 2 and (0.49+0.15+0.02 -0.11-0.01) SNur h 2 in C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively. The SN rate for the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) is found to be (2.04+1.99+0.07 -1.11-0.04) SNur h 2 and (0.36+0.84+0.01 -0.30-0.01) SNur h 2 in C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively. The ratio of the SN Ia rate in cluster early-type galaxies to that of the SN Ia rate in field early-type galaxies is 1.94+1.31+0.043 -0.91-0.015 and 3.02+1.31+0.062 -1.03-0.048, for C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively. The SN rate in galaxy clusters as a function of redshift, which probes the late time SN Ia delay distribution, shows only weak dependence on redshift. Combining our current measurements with previous measurements, we fit the cluster SN Ia rate data to a linear function of redshift, and find rL = [(0.49+0.15 -0.14)+(0.91+0.85 -0.81) × z] SNuB h 2. A comparison of the radial distribution of SNe in cluster to field early-type galaxies shows possible evidence for an enhancement of the SN rate in the cores of cluster early-type galaxies. With an observation of at most three hostless, intra-cluster SNe Ia, we estimate the fraction of cluster SNe that are hostless to be (9.4+8.3 -5.1)%.},

Based on consideration of 87 spectroscopically confirmed non-Ia SNe discovered by the SDSS-II SN Survey, we estimate that 2.04+1.61 -0.95% of the photometric SNe Ia may be misidentified. The sample of SNe Ia used in this measurement represents an order of magnitude increase in the statistics for SN Ia rate measurements in the redshift range covered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. If we assume an SN Ia rate that is constant at low redshift (z < 0.15), then the SN observations can be used to infer a value of the SN rate of rV = (2.69+0.34+0.21 -0.30-0.01)×10-5 SNe yr-1 Mpc-3 (H 0/(70 km s-1 Mpc-1))3 at a mean redshift of ~0.12, based on 79 SNe Ia of which 72 are spectroscopically confirmed. However, the large sample of SNe Ia included in this study allows us to place constraints on the redshift dependence of the SN Ia rate based on the SDSS-II Supernova Survey data alone. Fitting a power-law model of the SN rate evolution, rV (z) = Ap × ((1 + z)/(1 + z 0))nu, over the redshift range 0.0 < z < 0.3 with z 0 = 0.21, results in Ap = (3.43+0.15 -0.15) × 10-5 SNe yr-1 Mpc-3 (H 0/(70 km s-1 Mpc-1))3 and nu = 2.04+0.90 -0.89.},

	Abstract = {We report on a comprehensive statistical analysis of observational data of the cosmic evolution of the supernova (SN) rate density, to derive constraints on cosmic star-formation history and the nature of a typeIa supernova (SNIa) progenitor. We use all available information concerning the magnitude, SN type, and redshift information of both typeIa and core-collapse (CC) SNe in GOODS and SDF, as well as SNIa rate densities reported in the literature. We also add 157 SN candidates in the past Subaru/Suprime-Cam data that are newly reported here, to increase the statistics. We find that the current data set of the SN rate density evolution already gives a meaningful constraint on the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at z ≲ 1, though strong constraints cannot be derived for the delay time distribution (DTD) of SNeIa. We derive a constraint of α ˜ 3--4 [the evolutionary index of SFR density ∝ (1+z)α at z ≲ 1] with evidence for a significant evolution of the mean extinction of CCSNe [E(B-V) ˜ 0.5 at z ˜ 0.5 compared with ˜ 0.2 at z=0], which does not change significantly within a reasonable range of various DTD models. This result is consistent with the systematic trend of α estimates based on galactic SFR indicators at different wavelengths (ultraviolet, Hα, and infrared), indicating that there is a strong evolution in the mean extinction of star-forming regions in galaxies at relatively low redshift range of z ≲ 0.5. These results are obtained by a method that is completely independent of galaxy surveys and, especially, there is no detection limit about the host galaxy luminosity in our analysis, giving a strong constraint on the star-formation activity in high-z dwarf galaxies or intergalactic space.},

	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate (SNRIa) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This analysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional photometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1 <= z <= 1.1. The volumetric SNRIa evolution is consistent with a rise to z ~ 1.0 that follows a power law of the form (1+z)alpha, with alpha = 2.11 $\pm$ 0.28. This evolutionary trend in the SNLS rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic star formation history (SFH) over the same redshift range. We combine the SNLS rate measurements with those from other surveys that complement the SNLS redshift range, and fit various simple SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) models to the combined data. A simple power-law model for the DTD (i.e., vpropt -beta) yields values from beta = 0.98 $\pm$ 0.05 to beta = 1.15 $\pm$ 0.08 depending on the parameterization of the cosmic SFH. A two-component model, where SNRIa is dependent on stellar mass (M stellar) and star formation rate (SFR) as SNRIa(z) = A × M stellar(z) + B × SFR(z), yields the coefficients A = (1.9 $\pm$ 0.1) × 10-14 SNe yr-1 M -1 &sun; and B = (3.3 $\pm$ 0.2) × 10-4 SNe yr-1 (M &sun; yr-1)-1. More general two-component models also fit the data well, but single Gaussian or exponential DTDs provide significantly poorer matches. Finally, we split the SNLS sample into two populations by the light-curve width (stretch), and show that the general behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8 <= s < 1.0) is similar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects (1.0 <= s < 1.3) out to z ~ 0.8.},

	Abstract = {The presence of a nearby companion alters the evolution of massive stars in binary systems, leading to phenomena such as stellar mergers, x-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts. Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We identify a sample of 22 host galaxies of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at redshifts 0.95 < z < 1.8 discovered in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. We measure the photometry of the hosts in Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based imaging of the GOODS fields to provide flux densities from the U band to 24 mum. We fit the broadband photometry of each host with simple stellar population models to estimate the age of the stellar population giving rise to the SN Ia explosions. We break the well-known age-extinction degeneracy in such analyses using the Spitzer 24 mum data to place upper limits on the thermally reprocessed, far-infrared emission from dust. The ages of these stellar populations give us an estimate of the delay times between the first epoch of star formation in the galaxies and the explosion of the SNe Ia. We find a bi-modal distribution of delay times ranging from 0.06 to 4.75 Gyr although at the 95% confidence interval, the delay time distribution is consistent with a single power law as well. We also constrain the first epoch of low-mass star formation using these results, showing that stars of mass lsim8 M sun were formed within 3 Gyr after the big bang and possibly by z ~ 6. This argues against a truncated stellar initial mass function in high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {I discuss a novel approach to identifying cosmic events in separate and independent observations. The focus is on the true events, such as supernova explosions, that happen once and, hence, whose measurements are not repeatable. Their classification and analysis must make the best use of all available data. Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to associate streams of events in space and time. Probabilities are assigned to the matches by studying their rates of occurrence. A case study of Type Ia supernovae illustrates how to use light curves in the cross-identification process. Constraints from realistic light curves happen to be well approximated by Gaussians in time, which makes the matching process very efficient. Model-dependent associations are computationally more demanding but can further boost one's confidence.},

	Abstract = {We present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using the Supernova Legacy Survey three-year sample (SNLS3) of Guy et al. and Conley et al. We use the 472 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in this sample, accounting for recently discovered correlations between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy properties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertainties directly in the cosmological fits. Combining the SNLS3 data with the full WMAP7 power spectrum, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and a prior on the Hubble constant H 0 from SHOES, in a flat universe we find Omega m  = 0.269 $\pm$ 0.015 and w = -1.061+0.069 - 0.068 (where the uncertainties include all statistical and SN Ia systematic errors)---a 6.5% measure of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertainties dominated by the photometric calibration of the SN Ia fluxes---without these calibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. When relaxing the assumption of flatness, we find Omega m  = 0.271 $\pm$ 0.015, Omega k  = -0.002 $\pm$ 0.006, and w = -1.069+0.091 - 0.092. Parameterizing the time evolution of w as w(a) = w 0 + wa (1 - a) gives w 0 = -0.905 $\pm$ 0.196, wa = -0.984+1.094 - 1.097 in a flat universe. All of our results are consistent with a flat, w = -1 universe. The size of the SNLS3 sample allows various tests to be performed with the SNe segregated according to their light curve and host galaxy properties. We find that the cosmological constraints derived from these different subsamples are consistent. There is evidence that the coefficient, beta, relating SN Ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at >4sigma significance (in addition to the known SN luminosity-host relation); however, this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and is currently a subdominant systematic.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the three-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) Supernova (SN) Survey data and identify a sample of 1070 photometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) candidates based on their multiband light curve data. This sample consists of SN candidates with no spectroscopic confirmation, with a subset of 210 candidates having spectroscopic redshifts of their host galaxies measured while the remaining 860 candidates are purely photometric in their identification. We describe a method for estimating the efficiency and purity of photometric SN Ia classification when spectroscopic confirmation of only a limited sample is available, and demonstrate that SN Ia candidates from SDSS-II can be identified photometrically with ~91% efficiency and with a contamination of ~6%. Although this is the largest uniform sample of SN candidates to date for studying photometric identification, we find that a larger spectroscopic sample of contaminating sources is required to obtain a better characterization of the background events. A Hubble diagram using SN candidates with no spectroscopic confirmation, but with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts, yields a distance modulus dispersion that is only ~20%-40% larger than that of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia sample alone with no significant bias. A Hubble diagram with purely photometric classification and redshift-distance measurements, however, exhibits biases that require further investigation for precision cosmology.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of two ultraluminous supernovae (SNe) at z ≈ 0.9 with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. These SNe, PS1-10ky and PS1-10awh, are among the most luminous SNe ever discovered, comparable to the unusual transients SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6. Like SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6, they show characteristic high luminosities (M bol ≈ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a few broad absorption lines, and no evidence for H or He. We have constructed a full multi-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time series spectroscopy for these SNe. Given the similarities between the SNe, we combine their light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course of explosion of (0.9-1.4) × 1051 erg. We find photospheric velocities of 12,000-19,000 km s-1 with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3 rest-frame weeks around light curve peak, consistent with the expansion of an optically thick massive shell of material. We show that, consistent with findings for other ultraluminous SNe in this class, radioactive decay is not sufficient to power PS1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for these events: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse SN, or SN shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star.},

	Abstract = {Consistency between Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) and SDSS-II Supernova Survey ugri measurements has been evaluated by comparing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and CSP photometry for nine spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova observed contemporaneously by both programs. The CSP data were transformed into the SDSS photometric system. Sources of systematic uncertainty have been identified, quantified, and shown to be at or below the 0.023 mag level in all bands. When all photometry for a given band is combined, we find average magnitude differences of equal to or less than 0.011 mag in ugri, with rms scatter ranging from 0.043 to 0.077 mag. The u-band agreement is promising, with the caveat that only four of the nine supernovae are well observed in u and these four exhibit an 0.038 mag supernova-to-supernova scatter in this filter.},

	Abstract = {Classifier combination methods need to make best use of the outputs of multiple, imperfect classifiers to enable higher accuracy classifications. In many situations, such as when human decisions need to be combined, the base decisions can vary enormously in reliability. A Bayesian approach to such uncertain combination allows us to infer the differences in performance between individuals and to incorporate any available prior knowledge about their abilities when training data is sparse. In this paper we explore Bayesian classifier combination, using the computationally efficient framework of variational Bayesian inference. We apply the approach to real data from a large citizen science project, Galaxy Zoo Supernovae, and show that our method far outperforms other established approaches to imperfect decision combination. We go on to analyse the putative community structure of the decision makers, based on their inferred decision making strategies, and show that natural groupings are formed. Finally we present a dynamic Bayesian classifier combination approach and investigate the changes in base classifier performance over time.},

	Abstract = {Comparing the ejecta velocities at maximum brightness and narrow circumstellar/interstellar Na D absorption line profiles of a sample of 23 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we determine that the properties of SN Ia progenitor systems and explosions are intimately connected. As demonstrated by Sternberg et al., half of all SNe Ia with detectable Na D absorption at the host-galaxy redshift in high-resolution spectroscopy have Na D line profiles with significant blueshifted absorption relative to the strongest absorption component, which indicates that a large fraction of SN Ia progenitor systems have strong outflows. In this study, we find that SNe Ia with blueshifted circumstellar/interstellar absorption systematically have higher ejecta velocities and redder colors at maximum brightness relative to the rest of the SN Ia population. This result is robust at a 98.9%-99.8% confidence level, providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of the explosion. This finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is the correct interpretation of the blueshifted Na D absorption, adding additional confirmation that some SNe Ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitor channel. An additional implication is that either SN Ia progenitor systems have highly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the SN explosion or SNe Ia come from a variety of progenitor systems where SNe Ia from systems with strong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those from systems with weak or no outflows.},

	Abstract = {We present new radial velocity and X-ray observations of extremely low mass (ELM, ~0.2 M ☉) white dwarf (WD) candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 area. We identify seven new binary systems with 1-18 hr orbital periods. Five of the systems will merge due to gravitational wave radiation within 10 Gyr, bringing the total number of merger systems found in the ELM Survey to 24. The ELM Survey has now quintupled the known merger WD population. It has also discovered the eight shortest period detached binary WD systems currently known. We discuss the characteristics of the merger and non-merger systems observed in the ELM Survey, including their future evolution. About half of the systems have extreme mass ratios. These are the progenitors of the AM Canum Venaticorum systems and Type Ia supernovae. The remaining targets will lead to the formation of extreme helium stars, subdwarfs, or massive WDs. We identify three targets that are excellent gravitational wave sources. These should be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna like missions within the first year of operation. The remaining targets are important indicators of what the Galactic foreground may look like for gravitational wave observatories.

	Abstract = {The lack of hydrogen in spectra of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is often seen as troublesome for single-degenerate (SD) progenitor models. We argue that, since continued accretion of angular momentum can prevent explosion of the white dwarf, it may be natural for the donor stars in SD progenitors of SNe Ia to exhaust their envelopes and shrink rapidly before the explosion. This outcome seems most likely for SD SN Ia progenitors where mass transfer begins from a giant donor star and might extend to other SD systems. Not only is the amount of hydrogen left in such a system below the current detection limit, but the donor star is typically orders of magnitude smaller than its Roche lobe by the point when an SD SN Ia occurs, in which case attempts to observe collisions between SN shocks and giant donor stars seem unlikely to succeed. We consider the constraints on this model from the circumstellar structures seen in spectra of SN 2006X and suggest a novel explanation for the origin of this material.},

@article{Di-Stefano:2011,
	Abstract = {In the single-degenerate scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a white dwarf (WD) must gain a significant amount of matter from a companion star. Because the accreted mass carries angular momentum, the WD is likely to achieve fast spin periods, which can increase the critical mass, M crit, needed for explosion. When M crit is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD, the central regions of the WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces super-Chandrasekhar single-degenerate explosions, and a delay between the completion of mass gain and the time of the explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore has a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a density similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also, either by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion, the donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters, generally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star. Nevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive. Prior to explosion, progenitors can be super-M Ch WDs in either wide binaries with WD companions or cataclysmic variables. These systems can be discovered and studied through wide-field surveys. Post-explosion, the spin-up/spin-down model predicts a population of fast-moving WDs, low-mass stars, and even brown dwarfs. In addition, the spin-up/spin-down model provides a paradigm which may be able to explain both the similarities and the diversity observed among SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {Pristine stars with masses between ˜140 and 260 M&sun; are theoretically predicted to die as pair-instability supernovae. These very massive progenitors could come from Population III (Pop III) stars in the early universe. We model the light curves and spectra of pair-instability supernovae over a range of masses and envelope structures. At redshifts of reionization z>= 6, we calculate the rates and detectability of pair-instability and core-collapse supernovae, and show that with the James Webb Space Telescope it is possible to determine the contribution of Pop III and Pop II stars towards reionization by constraining the stellar initial mass function at that epoch using these supernovae. We also find the rates of Type Ia supernovae, and show that they are not rare during reionization, and can be used to probe the mass function at 4-8 M&sun;. If the budget of ionizing photons was dominated by contributions from top-heavy Pop III stars, we predict that the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function will be contaminated by pair-instability supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We present 2603 spectra of 462 nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), including 2065 previously unpublished spectra, obtained during 1993-2008 through the Center for Astrophysics Supernova Program. There are on average eight spectra for each of the 313 SNe Ia with at least two spectra. Most of the spectra were obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory 1.5 m telescope and reduced in a consistent manner, making this data set well suited for studies of SN Ia spectroscopic diversity. Using additional data from the literature, we study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the classification schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width-luminosity relation appears to be steeper for SNe Ia with broader lines, although the result is not statistically significant with the present sample. Based on the evolution of the characteristic Si II lambda6355 line, we propose improved methods for measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously suspected, from ~0 to ~400 km s-1 day-1 considering the instantaneous velocity decline rate at maximum light. We find a weaker and less significant correlation between Si II velocity and intrinsic B - V color at maximum light than reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of uncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and the presence of unburnt carbon in the outermost layers of the ejecta and report new detections of C II lambda6580 in 23 early-time SN Ia spectra. The frequency of C II detections is not higher in SNe Ia with bluer colors or narrower light curves, in conflict with the recent results of Thomas et al. Based on nebular spectra of 27 SNe Ia, we find no relation between the FWHM of the iron emission feature at ~4700 {\AA} and Deltam 15(B) after removing the two low-luminosity SN 1986G and SN 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent on the kinetic energy of the explosion for most SNe Ia. Finally, we confirm the correlation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic B - V color of SNe Ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possible non-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts. Based in part on observations obtained at the F. L. Whipple Observatory, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona, and with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

@article{Geier:2007,
	Abstract = {Context: The nature of the progenitors of type Ia supernovae is still under debate. KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN Ia progenitor candidates known today. The object is a double degenerate system consisting of a subluminous B star (sdB) and a massive white dwarf (WD). Maxted et al. ([CITE]) conclude that the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion, however, rests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Msun. However, recent binary population synthesis calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star may range from 0.3 Msun to more than 0.7 Msun. 
Aims: It is therefore important to measure the mass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf. Since the rotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the orbit, the inclination of the system can be constrained if the sdB radius and the projected rotational velocity can be measured with high precision. An analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the light curve allows the constraints derived from spectroscopy to be tightened. 
Methods: We derived the mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a quantitative spectral analysis of 150 low-resolution spectra obtained with the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope using metal-rich, line-blanketed LTE model atmospheres with and without NLTE line formation. The projected rotational velocity was determined for the first time from 200 high-resolution spectra obtained with the Keck I 10 m and with the ESO-VLT 8.2 m telescopes. In addition a reanalysis of the published light curve was performed. 
Results: The atmospheric and orbital parameters were measured with unprecedented accuracy. In particular the projected rotational velocity <[(v_rot sin{i} = 92.3 $\pm$ 1.5 km s-1)]> was determined. Assuming the companion to be a white dwarf, the mass of the sdB is limited between <[(0.45 Msun)]> and <[(0.64 Msun)]> and the corresponding total mass of the system ranges from <[(1.33 Msun)]> to <[(2.04 Msun)]>. This constrains the inclination to i>68$\,^{\circ}$. The photometric analysis allows the parameters to be constrained even more. A neutron star companion can be ruled out and the mass of the sdB is limited to the range between <[(0.45 Msun)]> and <[(0.52 Msun)]>. The total mass of the system ranges from <[(1.36 Msun)]> to <[(1.48 Msun)]> and hence is likely to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass. The inclination angle is 80$\,^{\circ}$ and the light curve shows weak and shallow signs of eclipses. A high-precision light curve is needed in order to accurately measure these eclipses. So KPD 1930+2752 qualifies as an excellent double degenerate supernova Ia progenitor candidate.

	Abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of SBS 1150+599A, a close binary star hosted by the planetary nebula PN G135.9+55.9 (TS 01). The nebula, located in the Galactic halo, is the most oxygen-poor known to date and is the only one known to harbor a double degenerate core. We present XMM-Newton observations of this object, which allowed the detection of the previously invisible component of the binary core, whose existence was inferred so far only from radial velocity (RV) and photometric variations. The parameters of the binary system were deduced from a wealth of information via three independent routes using the spectral energy distribution (from the infrared to X-rays), the light and RV curves, and a detailed model atmosphere fitting of the stellar absorption features of the optical/UV component. We find that the cool component must have a mass of 0.54 $\pm$ 0.2 M sun, an average effective temperature, T eff, of 58,000 $\pm$ 3000 K, a mean radius of 0.43 $\pm$ 0.3 R sun, a gravity, log g = 5.0 $\pm$ 0.3, and that it nearly fills its Roche lobe. Its surface elemental abundances are found to be: 12 + log He/H = 10.95 $\pm$ 0.04 dex, 12 + log C/H = 7.20 $\pm$ 0.3 dex, 12 + log N/H < 6.92, and 12 + log O/H < 6.80, in overall agreement with the chemical composition of the planetary nebula. The hot component has T eff = 160-180 kK, a luminosity of about ~104 L sun and a radius slightly larger than that of a white dwarf. It is probably bloated and heated as a result of intense accretion and nuclear burning on its surface in the past. The total mass of the binary system is very close to the Chandrasekhar limit. This makes TS 01 one of the best Type Ia supernova progenitor candidates. We propose two possible scenarios for the evolution of the system up to its present stage.},

	Abstract = {SDSS 1257+5428 is a white dwarf in a close orbit with a companion that has been suggested to be a neutron star. If so, it hosts the closest known neutron star, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate of white dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova rate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which confirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white dwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass and the other hotter and more massive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling (various factors combine to lower the latter by more than 2 orders of magnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two hydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity component are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just pressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to rotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid rotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically, it appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is lost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This suggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well, with B ~= 105 G. Alternatively, the broadening seen in the spectral lines could be due to a stronger magnetic field, of ~106 G. The two models can be distinguished by further observations.},

	Abstract = {Observations of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) open a novel opportunity to study the massive star population in the early Universe. We study the detectability of superluminous SNe with upcoming optical and near-infrared (NIR) surveys. Our calculations are based on the cosmic star-formation history, the SN occurrence rate, the characteristic colour and the light curve of the SNe, which are all calibrated using available observations. We show that 15-150 SNe up to z˜ 4 will be discovered by the proposed Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam deep survey, a 30-deg2 survey with 24.5 AB mag depth in the z band for 3 months. With its ultradeep layer (3.5 deg2 with 25.6 AB mag depth in the z band for 4 months), the highest redshift can be extended to z˜ 5. We further explore the detectability by upcoming NIR surveys utilizing future satellites such as Euclid, WFIRST and WISH. The wide-field NIR surveys are very efficient at detecting high-redshift SNe. With a hypothetical deep NIR survey for 100 deg2 with 26 AB mag depth, at least ˜50 SNe will be discovered at z > 3 in half a year. The number of detected SNe can place a strong constraint on the stellar initial mass function or its slope, especially at the high-mass end. Superluminous SNe at high redshifts can be distinguished from other types of SNe by the long time-scale of their light curves in the observer's frame, optical colours redder than other core-collapse SNe and NIR colours redder than any other type of SNe.},

	Abstract = {We propose a simple model for dark energy useful for comparison with observations. It is based on the idea that dark energy and inflation should be caused by the same physical process. As motivation, we note that Linde's simple chaotic inflation ? produces values of ns= 0.967 and r= 0.13, which are consistent with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 1sigma error bars. We therefore propose ? with m1˜ 10-5 and m2<= 10-60, where c= 1 =&plank; and the reduced Planck mass is set to unity. The field phi1 drives inflation and has damped by now (phi1, 0= 0), while phi2 is currently rolling down its potential to produce dark energy. Using this model, we derive the formula deltaw(z) ≡w(z) + 1 =deltaw0(H0/H(z))2 via the slow-roll approximation. Our numerical results from exact and self-consistent solution of the equations of motion for phi2 and the Friedmann equations support this formula, and it should hold for any slow-roll dark energy.  Our potential can be easily realized in N-flation models with many fields, and is easily falsifiable by upcoming experiments - for example, if Linde's chaotic inflation is ruled out. But if r values consistent with Linde's chaotic inflation are detected then one should take this model seriously indeed.},

	Abstract = {The nearby supernova SN 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail. Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models, which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN 2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white dwarfs (WDs)---realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most widely discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum, but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified. Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads to differences in the 55Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed sufficiently long to study this effect.},

	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the volumetric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate out to z ~= 1.6 from the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey. In observations spanning 189 orbits with the Advanced Camera for Surveys we discovered 29 SNe, of which approximately 20 are SNe Ia. Twelve of these SNe Ia are located in the foregrounds and backgrounds of the clusters targeted in the survey. Using these new data, we derive the volumetric SN Ia rate in four broad redshift bins, finding results consistent with previous measurements at z >~ 1 and strengthening the case for an SN Ia rate that is >~ 0.6 × 10-4 h 3 70 yr-1 Mpc-3 at z ~ 1 and flattening out at higher redshift. We provide SN candidates and efficiency calculations in a form that makes it easy to rebin and combine these results with other measurements for increased statistics. Finally, we compare the assumptions about host-galaxy dust extinction used in different high-redshift rate measurements, finding that different assumptions may induce significant systematic differences between measurements.  Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute. STScI is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program GO-10496.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 high redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 < z < 1.1) discovered during the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts.  Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields.  Results: A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega_M = 0.211 $\pm$ 0.034(stat) $\pm$ 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of $\pm$0.026 on Omega_M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope (beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.

	Abstract = {The original formulation of Bayesian estimation applied to multiple species (BEAMS) showed how to use a data set contaminated by points of multiple underlying types to perform unbiased parameter estimation. An example is cosmological parameter estimation from a photometric supernova sample contaminated by unknown Type Ibc and II supernovae. Where other methods require data cuts to increase purity, BEAMS uses all of the data points in conjunction with their probabilities of being each type. Here we extend the BEAMS formalism to allow for correlations between the data and the type probabilities of the objects as can occur in realistic cases. We show with simple simulations that this extension can be crucial, providing a 50 per cent reduction in parameter estimation variance when such correlations do exist. We then go on to perform tests to quantify the importance of the type probabilities, one of which illustrates the effect of biasing the probabilities in various ways. Finally, a general presentation of the selection bias problem is given, and discussed in the context of future photometric supernova surveys and BEAMS, which lead to specific recommendations for future supernova surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present Advanced Camera for Surveys, NICMOS, and Keck adaptive-optics-assisted photometry of 20 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cluster Supernova Survey. The SNe Ia were discovered over the redshift interval 0.623 < z < 1.415. Of these SNe Ia, 14 pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world's sample of SNe Ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. Of our new SNe Ia, 10 are beyond redshift z = 1, thereby nearly doubling the statistical weight of HST-discovered SNe Ia beyond this redshift. Our detailed analysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the NICMOS zero point at the count rates appropriate for very distant SNe Ia. Adding these SNe improves the best combined constraint on dark-energy density, rhoDE(z), at redshifts 1.0 < z < 1.6 by 18% (including systematic errors). For a flat LambdaCDM universe, we find OmegaLambda = 0.729 $\pm$ 0.014 (68% confidence level (CL) including systematic errors). For a flat wCDM model, we measure a constant dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.013+0.068 -0.073 (68% CL). Curvature is constrained to ~0.7% in the owCDM model and to ~2% in a model in which dark energy is allowed to vary with parameters w 0 and wa . Further tightening the constraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require several improvements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample of several dozen z > 1 SNe Ia. We describe how such a sample could be efficiently obtained by targeting cluster fields with WFC3 on board HST. The updated supernova Union2.1 compilation of 580 SNe is available at http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with program GO-10496.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at redshift z = 1.55 with the infrared detector of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3-IR) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This object was discovered in CANDELS imaging data of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and followed as part of the CANDELS+CLASH Supernova project, comprising the SN search components from those two HST multi-cycle treasury programs. This is the highest redshift SN Ia with direct spectroscopic evidence for classification. It is also the first SN Ia at z > 1 found and followed in the infrared, providing a full light curve in rest-frame optical bands. The classification and redshift are securely defined from a combination of multi-band and multi-epoch photometry of the SN, ground-based spectroscopy of the host galaxy, and WFC3-IR grism spectroscopy of both the SN and host. This object is the first of a projected sample at z > 1.5 that will be discovered by the CANDELS and CLASH programs. The full CANDELS+CLASH SN Ia sample will enable unique tests for evolutionary effects that could arise due to differences in SN Ia progenitor systems as a function of redshift. This high-z sample will also allow measurement of the SN Ia rate out to z ≈ 2, providing a complementary constraint on SN Ia progenitor models.},

	Abstract = {We use multi-epoch spectroscopy of ~4000 white dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to constrain the properties of the Galactic population of binary white dwarf systems and calculate their merger rate. With a Monte Carlo code, we model the distribution of DeltaRVmax, the maximum radial velocity shift between exposures of the same star, as a function of the binary fraction within 0.05 AU, f bin, and the power-law index in the separation distribution at the end of the common-envelope phase, alpha. Although there is some degeneracy between f bin and alpha, the 15 high-DeltaRVmax systems that we find constrain the combination of these parameters, which determines a white dwarf merger rate per unit stellar mass of 1.4+3.4 -1.0 × 10-13 yr-1 M -1 &sun; (1sigma limits). This is remarkably similar to the measured rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) per unit stellar mass in Milky-Way-like Sbc galaxies. The rate of super-Chandrasekhar mergers is only 1.0+1.6 -0.6 × 10-14 yr-1 M -1 &sun;. We conclude that there are not enough close binary white dwarf systems to reproduce the observed SN Ia rate in the "classic" double degenerate super-Chandrasekhar scenario. On the other hand, if sub-Chandrasekhar mergers can lead to SNe Ia, as has been recently suggested by some studies, they could make a major contribution to the overall SN Ia rate. Although unlikely, we cannot rule out contamination of our sample by M-dwarf binaries or non-Gaussian errors. These issues will be clarified in the near future by completing the follow-up of all 15 high-DeltaRVmax systems.},

	Abstract = {These are the findings of the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) Figure of Merit (FoM) Science Working Group (SWG), the FoMSWG. JDEM is a space mission planned by NASA and the DOE for launch in the 2016 time frame. The primary mission is to explore the nature of dark energy. In planning such a mission, it is necessary to have some idea of knowledge of dark energy in 2016, and a way to quantify the performance of the mission. In this paper we discuss these issues.},

	Abstract = {Supernovae have been confirmed to redshift z~1.7 (refs 1, 2) for type Ia (thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf) and to z~0.7 (refs 1, 3-5) for type II (collapse of the core of the star). The subclass type IIn (ref. 6) supernovae are luminous core-collapse explosions of massive stars and, unlike other types, are very bright in the ultraviolet, which should enable them to be found optically at redshifts z~2 and higher. In addition, the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material creates strong, long-lived emission lines that allow spectroscopic confirmation of many events of this type at z~2 for 3-5years after explosion (ref. 14). Here we report three spectroscopically confirmed type IIn supernovae, at redshifts z = 0.808, 2.013 and 2.357, detected in archival data using a method designed to exploit these properties at z~2. Type IIn supernovae directly probe the formation of massive stars at high redshift. The number found to date is consistent with the expectations of a locally measured stellar initial mass function, but not with an evolving initial mass function proposed to explain independent observations at low and high redshift.},

	Abstract = {In providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe, the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) has observed 71 high-z Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared bands Y and J. These can be used to construct rest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yield distance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-rate corrections than in the optical. However, working with NIR observed and i-band rest-frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24 high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in the Hubble flow is used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions are not dominated by the Hubble flow.},

	Abstract = {The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate, when compared to the cosmic star formation history (SFH), can be used to derive the delay-time distribution (DTD; the hypothetical SN Ia rate versus time following a brief burst of star formation) of SNe Ia, which can distinguish among progenitor models. We present the results of a supernova (SN) survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3 years, we have observed the SDF on four independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with two nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i'and z' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z≈ 2. Using 11 photometric bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final sample includes 28 SNe Ia in the range 1.0 < z < 1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5 < z < 2.0. As our survey is largely insensitive to core-collapse SNe (CC SNe) at z > 1, most of the events found in this range are likely SNe Ia. Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) sample, but the overall uncertainty of our 1.5 < z < 2.0 measurement is a factor of 2 smaller, of 35-50 per cent. Based on this sample, we find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels off at 1.0 < z < 2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of possible SFHs, the best-fitting DTD (with a reduced chi2= 0.7) is a power law of the form Psi(t) ∝tbeta, with index beta=-1.1 $\pm$ 0.1 (statistical) $\pm$0.17 (systematic). This result is consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. Most single-degenerate models predict different DTDs. By combining the contribution from CC SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs, with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fitting DTD, we predict that the mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range ZFe= (0.09-0.37) ZFe, &sun;. We further predict that the high-z SN searches now beginning with HST will discover 2-11 SNe Ia at z > 2.},

	Abstract = {We present detailed optical photometry for 25 Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) within d ≈ 150 Mpc obtained with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope in 2004-2007. This study represents the first uniform, systematic, and statistical sample of multi-band SNe Ibc light curves available to date. We correct the light curves for host galaxy extinction using a new technique based on the photometric color evolution, namely, we show that the (V - R) color of extinction-corrected SNe Ibc at Deltat ≈ 10 days after V-band maximum is tightly distributed, lang(V - R) V10rang = 0.26 $\pm$ 0.06 mag. Using this technique, we find that SNe Ibc typically suffer from significant host galaxy extinction, langE(B - V)rang ≈ 0.4 mag. A comparison of the extinction-corrected light curves for helium-rich (Type Ib) and helium-poor (Type Ic) SNe reveals that they are statistically indistinguishable, both in luminosity and decline rate. We report peak absolute magnitudes of langMR rang = -17.9 $\pm$ 0.9 mag and langMR rang = -18.3 $\pm$ 0.6 mag for SNe Ib and Ic, respectively. Focusing on the broad-lined (BL) SNe Ic, we find that they are more luminous than the normal SNe Ibc sample, langMR rang = -19.0 $\pm$ 1.1 mag, with a probability of only 1.6% that they are drawn from the same population of explosions. By comparing the peak absolute magnitudes of SNe Ic-BL with those inferred for local engine-driven explosions (GRB-SN 1998bw, XRF-SN 2006aj, and SN 2009bb) we find a 25% probability that relativistic SNe are drawn from the overall SNe Ic-BL population. Finally, we fit analytic models to the light curves to derive typical 56Ni masses of M Ni ≈ 0.2 and 0.5 M sun for SNe Ibc and SNe Ic-BL, respectively. With reasonable assumptions for the photospheric velocities, we further extract kinetic energy and ejecta mass values of M ej ≈ 2 M sun and EK ≈ 1051 erg for SNe Ibc, while for SNe Ic-BL we find higher values, M ej ≈ 5 M sun and EK ≈ 1052 erg. We discuss the implications for the progenitors of SNe Ibc and their relation to those of engine-driven explosions.},

	Abstract = {Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are rare events, constituting only a few percent of all core-collapse SNe, and the current sample of well-observed SNe IIn is small. Here, we study the four SNe IIn observed by the Caltech Core-Collapse Project (CCCP). The CCCP SN sample is unbiased to the extent that object selection was not influenced by target SN properties. Therefore, these events are representative of the observed population of SNe IIn. We find that a narrow P-Cygni profile in the hydrogen Balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitous feature of SNe IIn. Our light curves show a relatively long rise time (>20 days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01-0.15 mag day--1), and a typical V-band peak magnitude of MV = --18.4 $\pm$ 1.0 mag. We measure the progenitor star wind velocities (600-1400 km s--1) for the SNe in our sample and derive pre-explosion mass-loss rates (0.026-0.12 M ☉ yr--1). We compile similar data for SNe IIn from the literature and discuss our results in the context of this larger sample. Our results indicate that typical SNe IIn arise from progenitor stars that undergo luminous-blue-variable-like mass loss shortly before they explode.},

	Abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image >250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 109 M ☉ to z ≈ 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z ≈ 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5sigma point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5sigma point-source limit of H >~ 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products are described in a companion paper.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products and data reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ≈ 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.},

@article{Thomas:2011,
	Abstract = {We present convincing evidence of unburned carbon at photospheric velocities in new observations of five Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory. These SNe are identified by examining 346 spectra from 124 SNe obtained before +2.5 days relative to maximum. Detections are based on the presence of relatively strong C II lambda6580 absorption "notches" in multiple spectra of each SN, aided by automated fitting with the SYNAPPS code. Four of the five SNe in question are otherwise spectroscopically unremarkable, with ions and ejection velocities typical of SNe Ia, but spectra of the fifth exhibit high-velocity (v > 20, 000 km s--1) Si II and Ca II features. On the other hand, the light curve properties are preferentially grouped, strongly suggesting a connection between carbon-positivity and broadband light curve/color behavior: three of the five have relatively narrow light curves but also blue colors and a fourth may be a dust-reddened member of this family. Accounting for signal to noise and phase, we estimate that 22+10 -- 6% of SNe Ia exhibit spectroscopic C II signatures as late as --5 days with respect to maximum. We place these new objects in the context of previously recognized carbon-positive SNe Ia and consider reasonable scenarios seeking to explain a physical connection between light curve properties and the presence of photospheric carbon. We also examine the detailed evolution of the detected carbon signatures and the surrounding wavelength regions to shed light on the distribution of carbon in the ejecta. Our ability to reconstruct the C II lambda6580 feature in detail under the assumption of purely spherical symmetry casts doubt on a "carbon blobs" hypothesis, but does not rule out all asymmetric models. A low volume filling factor for carbon, combined with line-of-sight effects, seems unlikely to explain the scarcity of detected carbon in SNe Ia by itself.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies indicate that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) consist of two groups-a ``prompt'' component whose rates are proportional to the host galaxy star formation rate, whose members have broader light curves and are intrinsically more luminous, and a ``delayed'' component whose members take several Gyr to explode, have narrower light curves, and are intrinsically fainter. As cosmic star formation density increases with redshift, the prompt component should begin to dominate. We use a two-component model to predict that the average light curve width should increase by 6% from z=0 to 1.5. Using data from various searches, we find an 8.1% +/- 2.7% increase in average light curve width for non-subluminous SNe Ia from z=0.03 to 1.12, corresponding to an increase in the average intrinsic luminosity of 12%. To test whether there is any bias after supernovae are corrected for light curve shape we use published data to mimic the effect of population evolution and find no significant difference in the measured dark energy equation of state parameter, w. However, future measurements of time-variable w will require standardization of SN Ia magnitudes to 2% up to z=1.7, and it is not yet possible to assess whether light curve shape correction works at this level of precision. Another concern at z=1.5 is the expected order-of-magnitude increase in the number of SNe Ia that cannot be calibrated by current methods.},

	Abstract = {Metallicity is expected to influence not only the lives of massive stars but also the outcome of their deaths as supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, there are surprisingly few direct measurements of the local metallicities of different flavors of core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). Here, we present the largest existing set of host-galaxy spectra with H II region emission lines at the sites of 35 stripped-envelope CCSNe. We derive local oxygen abundances in a robust manner in order to constrain the SN Ib/c progenitor population. We obtain spectra at the SN sites, include SNe from targeted and untargeted surveys, and perform the abundance determinations using three different oxygen-abundance calibrations. The sites of SNe Ic (the demise of the most heavily stripped stars, having lost both H and He layers) are systematically more metal rich than those of SNe Ib (arising from stars that retained their He layer) in all calibrations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields the very low probability of 1% that SN Ib and SN Ic environment abundances, which are different on average by ~0.2 dex (in the Pettini & Pagel scale), are drawn from the same parent population. Broad-lined SNe Ic (without GRBs) occur at metallicities between those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic. Lastly, we find that the host-galaxy central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local SN metallicity; hence, large-scale SN surveys need to obtain local abundance measurements in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on stellar death.},

	Abstract = {We use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (SNe) from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) to study their observed subtype distribution in dwarf galaxies compared to giant galaxies. Our sample is the largest single-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collection of core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosity range (down to Mr ≈ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (>20%) of dwarf (Mr >= -18 mag) hosts. We find more core-collapse SNe in dwarf galaxies than expected and several interesting trends emerge. We use detailed subclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe and find that all Type I core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either SNe Ib or broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL), while "normal" SNe Ic dominate in giant galaxies. We also see a significant excess of SNe IIb in dwarf hosts. We hypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss is reduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as "normal" SNe Ic in metal-rich galaxies to retain some He and H, exploding as Ib/IIb events. At the same time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive stripping and explode as SNe Ic-BL (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-ray bursts). Our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and our measurements of the observed N(Ib/c)/N(II) number ratio in dwarf and giant hosts (0.25+0.3 -0.15 and 0.23+0.11 -0.08, respectively; 1sigma uncertainties) are consistent with previous studies and theoretical predictions. As additional PTF data accumulate, more robust statistical analyses will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be probed via the dwarf-galaxy SN population.},

@article{Smith:2011,
	Abstract = {We analyse the observed fractions of core-collapse supernova (SN) types from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), and we discuss the corresponding implications for massive star evolution. For a standard initial mass function, observed fractions of SN types cannot be reconciled with the expectations of single-star evolution. The mass range of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars that shed their hydrogen envelopes via their own mass-loss accounts for less than half of the observed fraction of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc). The true progenitors of SNe Ibc must extend to a much lower range of initial masses than classical WR stars, and we argue that most SN Ibc and SN IIb progenitors must arise from binary Roche lobe overflow. In this scenario, SNe Ic would still trace higher initial mass and metallicity, because line-driven winds in the WR stage remove the helium layer and propel the transition from SN Ib to Ic. Less massive progenitors of SNe Ib and IIb may not be classical WR stars; they may be underluminous with weak winds, possibly hidden by overluminous mass-gainer companions that could appear as B[e] supergiants or related objects having aspherical circumstellar material. The remaining SN types (II-P, II-L and IIn) need to be redistributed across the full range of initial masses, so that even some very massive single stars retain H envelopes until explosion. We consider the possibility of direct collapse to black holes without visible SNe, but find this hypothesis difficult to accommodate in most scenarios. Major areas of remaining uncertainty are (1) the detailed influence of binary separation, rotation and metallicity; (2) mass differences in progenitors of SNe IIn compared to SNe II-L and II-P; and (3) the fraction of SNe Ic arising from single stars with the help of eruptive mass-loss, how this depends on metallicity and how it relates to diversity within the SN Ic subclass. Continued studies of progenitor stars and their environments in nearby galaxies, accounting for SN types, may eventually test these ideas.},

	Abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and type Ib/c supernovae (SNe Ib/c) are amongst nature's most magnificent explosions. While GRBs launch relativistic jets, SNe Ib/c are core-collapse explosions whose progenitors have been stripped of their hydrogen and helium envelopes. Yet for over a decade, one of the key outstanding questions is what conditions lead to each kind of explosion in massive stars. Determining the fates of massive stars is not only a vibrant topic in itself, but also impacts using GRBs as star formation indicators over distances up to 13 billion light-years and for mapping the chemical enrichment history of the universe. This article reviews a number of comprehensive observational studies that probe the progenitor environments, their metallicities and the explosion geometries of SN with and without GRBs, as well as the emerging field of SN environmental studies. Furthermore, it discusses SN 2008D/XRT 080109, which was discovered serendipitously with the Swift satellite via its X-ray emission from shock breakout and which generated great interest amongst both observers and theorists while illustrating a novel technique for stellar forensics. The article concludes with an outlook on how the most promising venues of research - with the many existing and upcoming large-scale surveys such as PTF and LSST - will shed new light on the diverse deaths of massive stars.

	Abstract = {We present the photometric calibration of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The ACS was installed in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2002 March. It comprises three cameras: the Wide Field Channel (WFC), optimized for deep near-IR survey imaging programs; the High Resolution Channel (HRC), a high-resolution imager that fully samples the HST point-spread function (PSF) in the visible; and the Solar Blind Channel (SBC), a far-UV imager. A significant amount of data has been collected to characterize the on-orbit performance of the three channels. We give here an overview of the performance and calibration of the two CCD cameras (WFC and HRC) and a description of the best techniques for reducing ACS CCD data. The overall performance is as expected from prelaunch testing of the camera. Surprises were a better-than-predicted sensitivity in the visible and near-IR for both the WFC and HRC and an unpredicted dip in the HRC UV response at ~3200 {\AA}. On-orbit observations of spectrophotometric standard stars have been used to revise the prelaunch estimate of the instrument response curves to best match predicted and observed count rates. Synthetic photometry has been used to determine zero points for all filters in three magnitude systems and to derive interstellar extinction values for the ACS photometric systems. Due to the CCD internal scattering of long-wavelength photons, the width of the PSF increases significantly in the near-IR, and the aperture correction for photometry with near-IR filters depends on the spectral energy distribution of the source. We provide a detailed recipe to correct for the latter effect. Transformations between the ACS photometric systems and the UBVRI and WFPC2 systems are presented. In general, two sets of transformations are available: one based on the observation of two star clusters; the other on synthetic photometry. We discuss the accuracy of these transformations and their sensitivity to details of the spectra being transformed. Initial signs of detector degradation due to the HST radiative environment are already visible. We discuss the impact on the data in terms of dark rate increase, charge transfer inefficiency, and ``hot'' pixel population.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the supernova (SN) delay time distribution (DTD)---the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation---can shed light on SN progenitors and physics, as well as on the timescales of chemical enrichment in different environments. We compile recent measurements of the Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at redshifts from z = 0 out to z = 1.45, just 2 Gyr after cluster star formation at z ≈ 3. We review the plausible range for the observed total iron-to-stellar mass ratio in clusters, based on the latest data and analyses, and use it to constrain the time-integrated number of SN Ia events in clusters. With these data, we recover the DTD of SNe Ia in cluster environments. The DTD is sharply peaked at the shortest time-delay interval we probe, 0Gyr < t < 2.2 Gyr, with a low tail out to delays of ~10 Gyr, and is remarkably consistent with several recent DTD reconstructions based on different methods, applied to different environments. We test DTD models from the literature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster SN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A parameterized power-law DTD of the form t -1.2$\pm$0.3 from t = 400 Myr to a Hubble time can satisfy both constraints. Shallower power laws such as t -1/2 cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a single star formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z. This implies that 50%-85% of SNe Ia explode within 1 Gyr of star formation. DTDs from double-degenerate (DD) models, which generically have ~t -1 shapes over a wide range of timescales, match the data, but only if their predictions are scaled up by factors of 5-10. Single-degenerate (SD) DTDs always give poor fits to the data, due to a lack of delayed SNe and overall low numbers of SNe. The observations can also be reproduced with a combination of two SN Ia populations---a prompt SD population of SNe Ia that explodes within a few Gyr of star formation, and produces about 60% of the iron mass in clusters, and a DD population that contributes the events seen at z < 1.5. An alternative scenario of a single, prompt, SN Ia population, but a composite star formation history in clusters, consisting of a burst at high z, followed by a constant star formation rate, can reproduce the SN rates, but is at odds with direct measurements of star formation in clusters at 0 < z < 1. Our results support the existence of a DD progenitor channel for SNe Ia, if the overall predicted numbers can be suitably increased.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {Recovery of the supernova (SN) delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation - can shed light on SN progenitors and physics, as well as on the time-scales of chemical enrichment. Previous attempts to reconstruct the DTD have been based either on comparison of mean SN rates versus redshift to cosmic star-formation history (SFH), or on the comparison of SN rates among galaxies with different mean ages. Here, we present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids the averaging and loss of information of other schemes. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of SNe discovered by a survey in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one SN, rarely a few). We apply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 type-Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 119 core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), that have SFHs reconstructed from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. We find a >2sigma SN Ia DTD signal in our shortest-delay, 'prompt' bin at <420 Myr. We identify and study a systematic error, due to the limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, that causes some of the prompt signal to leak to the later bins of the DTD. After accounting for this systematic error, we demonstrate that a prompt SN Ia contribution is required by the data at the >99 per cent confidence level. We further find a 4sigma indication of SNe Ia that are 'delayed' by >2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe Ia. We measure the time integral over the SN DTD. For CC SNe we find a total yield of 0.010 $\pm$ 0.002 SNe per M&sun; formed, in excellent agreement with expectations, if all stars more massive than 8 M&sun; lead to visible SN explosions. This argues against scenarios in which the minimum mass for core-collapse SNe is ≳10 M&sun;, or in which a significant fraction of massive stars collapse without an accompanying explosion. For SNe Ia, the time-integrated yield is 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0006 SNe per M&sun; formed, most of them with delays <2.4 Gyr. Finally, we show the robust performance of the method on simulated samples, and demonstrate that its application to already existing SN samples, such as the full LOSS sample, but with complete and unbiased SFH estimates for the survey galaxies, could provide an accurate and detailed measurement of the SN Ia DTD.},

@article{Rodney:2010a,
	Abstract = {
Wide-field surveys will soon be discovering Type Ia supernovae (SNe) at
rates of several thousand per year. Spectroscopic follow-up can only
scratch the surface for such enormous samples, so these extensive data
sets will only be useful to the extent that they can be characterized by
the survey photometry alone. In a companion paper we introduced the
Supernova Ontology with Fuzzy Templates (SOFT) method for analyzing SNe
using direct comparison to template light curves, and demonstrated its
application for photometric SN classification. In this work we extend
the SOFT method to derive estimates of redshift and luminosity distance
for Type Ia SNe, using light curves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) as a validation set. Redshifts
determined by SOFT using light curves alone are consistent with
spectroscopic redshifts, showing an rms scatter in the residuals of
rms<SUB> z </SUB> = 0.051. SOFT can also derive simultaneous redshift
and distance estimates, yielding results that are consistent with the
currently favored LambdaCDM cosmological model. When SOFT is given
spectroscopic information for SN classification and redshift priors, the
rms scatter in Hubble diagram residuals is 0.18 mag for the SDSS data
and 0.28 mag for the SNLS objects. Without access to any spectroscopic
information, and even without any redshift priors from host galaxy
photometry, SOFT can still measure reliable redshifts and distances,
with an increase in the Hubble residuals to 0.37 mag for the combined
SDSS and SNLS data set. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that
SOFT will be able to improve constraints on time-variable dark energy
models by a factor of 2-3 with each new generation of large-scale SN
surveys.

	Abstract = {The young stellar cluster illuminating the W40 H II region, one of the nearest massive star-forming regions, has been observed with the ACIS detector on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Due to its high obscuration, this is a poorly studied stellar cluster with only a handful of bright stars visible in the optical band, including three OB stars identified as primary excitation sources. We detect 225 X-ray sources, of which 85% are confidently identified as young stellar members of the region. Two potential distances of the cluster, 260 pc and 600 pc, are used in the paper. Supposing the X-ray luminosity function to be universal, it supports a 600 pc distance as a lower limit for W40 and a total population of at least 600 stars down to 0.1 M sun under the assumption of a coeval population with a uniform obscuration. In fact, there is strong spatial variation in Ks -band-excess disk fraction and non-uniform obscuration due to a dust lane that is identified in absorption in optical, infrared, and X-ray. The dust lane is likely part of a ring of material which includes the molecular core within W40. In contrast to the likely ongoing star formation in the dust lane, the molecular core is inactive. The star cluster has a spherical morphology, an isothermal sphere density profile, and mass segregation down to 1.5 M sun. However, other cluster properties, including a lsim1 Myr age estimate and ongoing star formation, indicate that the cluster is not dynamically relaxed. X-ray diffuse emission and a powerful flare from a young stellar object are also reported.},

	Abstract = {We compare models for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves and spectra with an extensive set of observations. The models come from a recent survey of 44 two-dimensional delayed-detonation models computed by Kasen et al., each viewed from multiple directions. The data include optical light curves of 251 SNe Ia, some of which have near-infrared observations, and 2231 low-dispersion spectra from the Center for Astrophysics, plus data from the literature. These allow us to compare a wide range of SN Ia models with observations for a wide range of luminosities and decline rates. The analysis uses standard techniques employed by observers, including MLCS2k2, SALT2 and SNooPy for light-curve analysis, and the Supernova Identification (SNID) code of Blondin & Tonry for spectroscopic comparisons to assess how well the models match the data. The ability to use the tools developed for observational data directly on the models marks a significant step forward in the realism of the models. We show that the models that match observed spectra best lie systematically on the observed width-luminosity relation. Conversely, we reject six models with highly asymmetric ignition conditions and a large amount (≳1 M&sun;) of synthesized 56Ni that yield poor matches to observed SN Ia spectra. More subtle features of the comparison include the general difficulty of the models to match the U-band flux at early times, caused by hot ionized ejecta that affect the subsequent redistribution of flux at longer wavelengths. The models have systematically higher velocities than the observed spectra at maximum light, as inferred from the Si II lambda6355 line. We examine ways in which the asymptotic kinetic energy of the explosion affects both the predicted velocity and velocity gradient in the Si II and Ca II lines. Models with an asymmetric distribution of 56Ni are found to result in a larger variation of photometric and spectroscopic properties with viewing angle, regardless of the initial ignition setup. We discuss more generally whether highly anisotropic ignition conditions are ruled out by observations, and how detailed comparisons between models and observations involving both light curves and spectra can lead to a better understanding of SN Ia explosion mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {We present in this paper a new three-dimensional galaxy classification system designed to account for the diversity of galaxy properties in the nearby universe. To construct this system we statistically analyse a sample of >22000 galaxies at v < 15000 km s-1 (z < 0.05) with Spearman rank and principal-component analyses (PCAs). Fourteen major galaxy properties are considered, including: Hubble type, size, colour, surface brightness, magnitude, stellar mass, internal velocities, HI gas content and an index that measures dynamical disturbances. We find, to a high degree, that most galaxy properties are correlated, with in particular Hubble type, colour and stellar mass all strongly related. We argue that this tight three-way correlation is a result of evolutionary processes that depend on galaxy mass, as we show that the relation between colour and mass is independent of Hubble type. Various PCAs reveal that most of the variation in nearby galaxy properties can be accounted for by eigenvectors dominated by (i) the scale of a galaxy, such as its stellar mass, (ii) the spectral type and (iii) the degree of dynamical disturbances. We suggest that these three properties: mass, star formation and interactions/mergers are the major features that determine a galaxy's physical state, and should be used to classify galaxies. As shown by Conselice et al., these properties are measurable within the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) structural system, thus providing an efficient mechanism for classifying galaxies in optical light within a physical meaningful framework. We furthermore discuss the fraction and number density of galaxies in the nearby universe as a function of Hubble type, for comparison with higher redshift populations.},

@article{Farrah:2002,
	Abstract = {We examine the host galaxies of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using archival I- and R-band data from the Hubble Space Telescope. The SNe Ia host galaxies show a wide variety of morphologies, including undisturbed ellipticals, spirals and disturbed systems. SNe Ia are also found over a wide range of projected distances from the host galaxy centres, ranging from 3 kpc to ~30 kpc. For a sample of 22 SNe Ia at <z>= 0.6, ~70 per cent are found in spiral galaxies and ~30 per cent are found in elliptical systems, similar to the proportions observed locally. Including data from Ellis & Sullivan (2001), we find no significant difference in the average light-curve shape-corrected MBpeak for high-z SNe Ia between spirals and ellipticals. These results are consistent with predictions based on the locally derived understanding of SNe Ia physics and the influence of progenitor mass and metallicity. We also construct colour maps for two host galaxies and find that both show a non-uniform colour structure with typical variations of rest-frame B-V~ 0.5. This is most plausibly attributed to the presence of, and variation in, dust extinction in these galaxies. Moreover, we find no evidence that the SNe Ia are preferentially found in outer regions (> 10 kpc) of the host galaxies where extinction would be low. This suggests that the range of host galaxy extinctions of SNe Ia at z~ 0.6 should be comparable to those of local SNe Ia. Although observational bias cannot be completely ruled out, this appears to be in conflict with the finding of low extinction for SNe Ia found in the high-z supernova search studies.},

@article{Hunter:2009,
	Abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations at optical and near-infrared wavelengths of the nearby type Ic supernova 2007gr. These represent the most extensive data-set to date of any supernova of this sub-type, with frequent coverage from shortly after discovery to more than one year post-explosion. We deduce a rise time to B-band maximum of 11.5 $\pm$ 2.7 d. We find a peak B-band magnitude of MB=-16.8, and light curves which are remarkably similar to the so-called ``hypernova'' SN 2002ap. In contrast, the spectra of SNe 2007gr and 2002ap show marked differences, not least in their respective expansion velocities. We attribute these differences primarily to the density profiles of their progenitor stars at the time of explosion i.e. a more compact star for SN 2007gr compared to SN 2002ap. From the quasi-bolometric light curve of SN 2007gr, we estimate that 0.076 $\pm$ 0.010~M_&sun; of 56Ni was produced in the explosion. Our near-infrared (IR) spectra clearly show the onset and disappearance of the first overtone of carbon monoxide (CO) between ~70 to 175 d relative to B-band maximum. The detection of the CO molecule implies that ionised He was not microscopically mixed within the carbon/oxygen layers. From the optical spectra, near-IR light curves, and colour evolution, we find no evidence for dust condensation in the ejecta out to about +400 d. Given the combination of unprecedented temporal coverage, and high signal-to-noise data, we suggest that SN 2007gr could be used as a template object for supernovae of this sub-class.

@article{Quimby:2011,
	Abstract = {Supernovae are stellar explosions driven by gravitational or thermonuclear energy that is observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeks or more. In all known supernovae, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited in the outflowing ejecta by one or more of the following processes: radioactive decay of freshly synthesized elements (typically 56Ni), the explosion shock in the envelope of a supergiant star, and interaction between the debris and slowly moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report observations of a class of luminous supernovae whose properties cannot be explained by any of these processes. The class includes four new supernovae that we have discovered and two previously unexplained events (SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as members of the same class. These supernovae are all about ten times brighter than most type Ia supernova, do not show any trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultraviolet flux for extended periods of time and have late-time decay rates that are inconsistent with radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation be emitted by hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~1015 centimetres) and expanding at high speeds (>104 kilometres per second). These long-lived, ultraviolet-luminous events can be observed out to redshifts z>4.},

@article{Sim:2010,
	Abstract = {Explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) are one alternative to the standard Chandrasekhar-mass model of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). They are interesting since binary systems with sub-Chandrasekhar-mass primary WDs should be common and this scenario would suggest a simple physical parameter which determines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding WD. Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated post-processing nucleosynthesis, and multi-wavelength radiation transport calculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen WDs. The light curves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with observed properties of SNe Ia. In particular, for WD masses from 0.97 to 1.15 M sun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 M sun, sufficient to capture almost the complete range of SN Ia brightnesses. Our optical light curve rise times, peak colors, and decline timescales display trends which are generally consistent with observed characteristics although the range of B-band decline timescales displayed by our current set of models is somewhat too narrow. In agreement with observations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear features associated with intermediate-mass elements and reproduce the sense of the observed correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the Si II lines at lambda6355 and lambda5972. We therefore suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are a viable model for SNe Ia for any binary evolution scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display is dominated by the material produced in a detonation of the primary WD.},

	Abstract = {We use the supernova remnants (SNRs) in the two Magellanic Clouds (MCs) as a supernova (SN) survey, `conducted' over tens of kyr, from which we derive the current SN rate, and the SN delay time distribution (DTD), i.e. the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of a star formation. In a companion paper we have compiled a list of 77 SNRs in the MCs, and argued that it is a fairly complete record of the SNRs that are now in the Sedov phase of their expansions. We recover the SN DTD by comparing the numbers of SNRs observed in small individual `cells' in these galaxies to the star formation histories of each cell, as calculated from resolved stellar populations by Harris & Zaritsky. We identify the visibility times of SNRs in each cell with the Sedov-phase lifetimes, which depend on the local ambient densities. The local densities are estimated from 21-cm emission, from an inverse Schmidt-Kennicutt law based on either Halpha emission or the star formation rate from the resolved stellar populations, and from combinations of these tracers. This is the first SN DTD that is based on resolved stellar populations. We detect a population of `prompt' Type Ia SNe (that explode within 330 Myr of star formation) at >99 per cent confidence level (CL). The best fit for the number of prompt Type Ia SNe per stellar mass formed is 2.7 -11.0 × 10-3 M-1solar, depending on the density tracer used. The 95 per cent CL range for a `delayed' (from 330 Myr to a Hubble time) Type Ia component is <1.6 × 10-13 SNyr-1 M-1solar, consistent with rate measurements in old populations. The current total (core-collapse+Ia) SN rate in the MCs is 2.5-4.6 SNe per millennium (68 per cent CL+systematics), or 1.7-3.1 SNuM [SNe (100 yr1010 Msolar) -1], in agreement with the historical record and with rates measured in other dwarf irregulars. Conversely, assuming the SNRs are in free expansion, rather than in their Sedov phase, would impose on the SNRs a maximum age of 6 kyr, and would imply an MC SN rate per unit mass that is five times higher than in any type of galaxy, and a low-mass limit for core-collapse progenitors in conflict with stellar evolution theory.},

@article{Sullivan:2010,
	Abstract = {Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08mag (~=4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star formation rates (sSFR). These trends do not depend on any assumed cosmological model, and are independent of the SN light-curve width: both fast and slow-declining events show the same trends. SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope (`beta') between their luminosities and colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95 per cent confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator using galaxy mass-metallicity relations, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w, the equation of state of dark energy. We show that the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass (metal-rich) galaxies and the other for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies, adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these terms give a significant reduction in chi2 (3.8sigma-4.5sigma) linear corrections based on host parameters do not perform as well. We conclude that all future SN Ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar) form to control demographic shifts in the underlying galaxy population.},

	Abstract = {We provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame UV continuum slope beta over a wide range in redshift (z ~ 2-6) and rest-frame UV luminosity (0.1 L* z = 3 to 2 L* z = 3) to improve estimates of the star formation rate (SFR) density at high redshift. We utilize the deep optical and infrared data (Advanced Camera for Surveys/NICMOS) over the Chandra Deep Field-South and Hubble Deep Field-North Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields, as well as the UDF for our primary UBVi "dropout" Lyman Break Galaxy sample. We also use strong lensing clusters to identify a population of very low luminosity, high-redshift dropout galaxies. We correct the observed distributions for both selection biases and photometric scatter. We find that the UV-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantially redder at z ~ 2-4 than it is at z ~ 5-6 (from ~-2.4 at z ~ 6 to ~-1.5 at z ~ 2). Lower luminosity galaxies are also found to be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z ~ 2.5 and z ~ 4. We do not find a large number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections at z ~ 4, and particularly at z gsim 5, even though such sources could be readily selected from our data (and also from Balmer Break Galaxy searches at z ~ 4). This suggests that star-forming galaxies at z gsim 5 almost universally have very blue UV-continuum slopes, and that there are not likely to be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z gsim 5 that are missed in "dropout" searches. Using the same relation between UV-continuum slope and dust extinction as has been found to be appropriate at both z ~ 0 and z ~ 2, we estimate the average dust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and UV luminosity in a consistent way. As expected, we find that the estimated dust extinction increases substantially with cosmic time for the most UV luminous galaxies, but remains small (lsim2 times) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. Because these same lower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the UV continuum, the overall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts and the evolution of this correction with redshift is only modest. We include the contribution from ultra-luminous IR galaxies in our SFR density estimates at z ~ 2-6, but find that they contribute only ~20% of the total at z ~ 2.5 and lsim10% at z gsim 4.

@article{Gallagher:2008,
	Abstract = {We have obtained optical spectra of 29 early-type (E/S0) galaxies that hosted Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We have measured absorption-line strengths and compared them to a grid of models to extract the relations between the supernova properties and the luminosity-weighted age/composition of the host galaxies. Such a direct measurement is a marked improvement over existing analyses that tend to rely on general correlations between the properties of stellar populations and morphology. We find a strong correlation suggesting that SNe Ia in galaxies whose populations have a characteristic age greater than 5 Gyr are ~1 mag fainter at Vmax than those found in galaxies with younger populations. We find that SN Ia distance residuals in the Hubble diagram are correlated with host-galaxy metal abundance with higher iron abundance galaxies hosting less-luminous supernovae. We thus conclude that the time since progenitor formation primarily determines the radioactive Ni production while progenitor metal abundance has a weaker influence on peak luminosity, but one not fully corrected by light-curve shape and color fitters. This result, particularly the secondary dependence on metallicity, has significant implications for the determination of the equation-of-state parameter, w=P/(rhoc2), and could impact planning for future dark-energy missions such as JDEM. Assuming no selection effects in discovering SNe Ia in local early-type galaxies, we find a higher specific SN Ia rate in E/S0 galaxies with ages below 3 Gyr than in older hosts. The higher rate and brighter luminosities seen in the youngest E/S0 hosts may be a result of recent star formation and represents a tail of the ``prompt'' SN Ia progenitors.},

@article{Komatsu:2011,
	Abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter LambdaCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m nu < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 $\pm$ 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21sigma, compared with 13sigma from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Delta alpha =-1.1$\pm$ 1.4$\,^{\circ}$ statistical $\pm$ 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {The influence of the initial composition of the exploding white dwarf on the nucleosynthesis, light curves, and spectra of Type Ia supernovae has been studied in order to evaluate the size of evolutionary effects on cosmological timescales, how the effects can be recognized, and how one may be able to correct for them. The calculations are based on a set of delayed detonation models that give a good account of the optical and infrared light curves and of the spectral evolution. The explosions and light curves are calculated using a one-dimensional Lagrangian radiation-hydro code including a nuclear network. Spectra are computed for various epochs using the structure resulting from the light-curve code. Our non-LTE code solves the relativistic radiation transport equations in the comoving frame consistently with the statistical equations and ionization due to gamma -radiation for the most important elements (C, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, Co, Ni). About 106 additional lines are included assuming LTE-level populations and an equivalent-two-level approach for the source functions. Changing the initial metallicity Z from Population I to Population II alters the isotopic composition of the outer layers of the ejecta that have undergone explosive O burning. Especially important is the increase of the 54Fe production with metallicity. The influence on the resulting rest-frame visual and blue light curves is found to be small. Detailed analysis of spectral evolution should permit a determination of the progenitor metallicity. Mixing 56Ni into the outer layers during the explosion can produce effects similar to an increased initial metallicity. Mixing can be distinguished from metallicity effects by means of the strong cobalt and nickel lines, by a change of the calcium lines in the optical and IR spectra and, in principle, by gamma -ray observations. As the C/O ratio of the white dwarf is decreased, the explosion energy and the 56Ni production are reduced, and the Si-rich layers are more confined in velocity space. A reduction of the C/O ratio by about 60% gives slower rise times by about three days, an increased luminosity at maximum light, a somewhat faster postmaximum decline, and a larger ratio between maximum light and 56Ni tail. A reduction of the C/O ratio has an effect on the colors, light-curve shapes and element distribution similar to a reduction in the deflagration to detonation transition density. However, for the same light-curve shape, the absolute brightness is larger for smaller C/O ratios. An independent determination of the initial C/O ratio and the transition density is possible for local supernovae if detailed analyses of both the spectra and light curves are performed simultaneously. Because the spectra are shifted into different color bands at different redshifts, the effect of metallicity Z on a given observed color is a strong function of redshift. A change of Z by a factor of 3 or of the C/O ratio by 33% alters the peak magnitudes in the optical wavelength range by up to ~0.3 mag for z >= 0.2. These variations are comparable to the effect of changes of Omega M and Lamda at redshifts of 0.5-1.0. The systematic effects due to changes in composition are expected to remain small up to about z ~ 0.5 for R-V and up to z ~ 0.7 for R-I. We discuss how evolution in the progenitor population can be recognized and taken into account. With proper account of evolutionary corrections, supernovae will provide a valuable tool to determine the cosmological parameters of the universe, and they will provide new insight into its chemical evolution.},

@article{Garnavich:1998b,
	Abstract = {We use Type Ia supernovae studied by the High-z Supernova Search Team to constrain the properties of an energy component that may have contributed to accelerating the cosmic expansion. We find that for a flat geometry the equation-of-state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x = P_x/rho_x, must be less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of Omega_m, and it is further limited to alpha_x < -0.60 (95% confidence) if Omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1. These values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topological defects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. The supernova (SN) data are consistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x = -1) or a scalar field that has had, on average, an equation-of-state parameter similar to the cosmological constant value of -1 over the redshift range of z ~ 1 to the present. SN and cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints on the densities of matter and the unknown component. If only matter and vacuum energy are considered, then the current combined data sets provide direct evidence for a spatially flat universe with Omega_tot = Omega_m + Omega_Lambda = 0.94 +/- 0.26 (1 sigma).},

	Abstract = {Detailed stellar evolution calculations have been performed to quantify the influence of the main-sequence mass MMS and the metallicity Z of the progenitor on the structure of the exploding white dwarf (WD), which are thought to be the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In particular, we study the effects of progenitors on the brightness-decline relation M(DeltaM15), which is a cornerstone for the use of SNe Ia as cosmological yardsticks. Both the typical MMS and Z can be expected to change as we go back in time. We consider the entire range of potential progenitors with 1.5-7 Msolar and metallicities between Z=0.02 and 1×10-10. Our study is based on the delayed detonation scenario with specific parameters that give a good account of typical light curves and spectra. Based on the structures for the WD, detailed model calculations have been performed for the hydrodynamical explosion, nucleosynthesis, and light curves. The main-sequence mass has been identified as the decisive factor to change the energetics of the explosion and, consequently, dominates the variations in the rise-time-decline relation of light curves. MMS has little effect on the color index B-V. For similar decline rates DeltaM15, the flux at maximum brightness relative to the flux on the radioactive tail decreases systematically with MMS by about 0.2m. This change goes along with a reduction of the photospheric expansion velocity vph by about 2000 km s-1. A change in the central density of the exploding WD has similar effects but produces the opposite dependency between the brightness-to-tail ratio and vph and therefore can be separated. The metallicity alters the isotopic composition of the outer layers of the ejecta. Selective line blanketing at short wavelengths decreases with Z and changes systematically the intrinsic color index B-V by up to -0.06m, and it alters the fluxes in the U band and the UV. The change in B-V is critical if extinction corrections are applied. The offset in the calibration of M(DeltaM15) is not monotonic in Z and, in general, remains <=0.07m. We use our results and recent observations to constrain the progenitors and to discuss evolutionary effects of SNe Ia with redshift. The narrow spread in the fiducial rise-time-decline relation in local SNe Ia restricts the range of main-sequence masses to a factor of 2. The upper limit of 1 day for the difference between the local and distance sample supports the need for a positive cosmological constant. The size of evolutionary effects is small (DeltaM~0.2m) but is absolutely critical for the reconstruction of the cosmological equation of state.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichment and SN physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star formation histories. We have carried out a survey for SNe in galaxy clusters, at a redshift range of 0.5 < z < 0.9, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that were previously imaged by ACS, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster in which we discovered five likely cluster SNe, six possible cluster Type Ia supernovae, two hostless SN candidates, and several background and foreground events. Keck spectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. We conducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellar luminosities of the clusters using Subaru images. We derive a cluster SN rate of 0.35SNu B  +0.17 -0.12(statistical) $\pm$0.13(classification) $\pm$0.01(systematic) (where SNu B  = SNe (100 yr 1010 L  B,sun)-1) and 0.112SNu M  +0.055 -0.039(statistical) $\pm$0.042(classification) $\pm$0.005(systematic) (where SNu M  = SNe (100 yr 1010 M sun)-1). As in previous measurements of cluster SN rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics. The SN rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the SN rate in clusters at lower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, at most, only a slight increase of cluster SN rate with increasing redshift. The low and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z ≈ 1 implies that the bulk of the iron mass in clusters was already in place by z ≈ 1. The recently observed doubling of iron abundances in the intracluster medium between z = 1 and 0, if real, is likely to be the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new production of iron.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO-10493 and GO-10793, and with archival programs GO-9033, GO-9090, GO-9290, GO-9292, GO-9722, GO-9744, GO-9836, and GO-10509.

	Abstract = {X-shooter is a single target spectrograph for the Cassegrain focus of one of the VLT UTs where it will start to operate in 2008. The instrument covers in a single exposure the spectral range from the UV to the K' band. It is designed to maximize the sensitivity in this spectral range through the splitting in three arms with optimized optics, coatings, dispersive elements and detectors. It operates at intermediate resolutions (R=4000-14000, depending on wavelength and slit width) with fixed echelle spectral format (with prism cross-dispersers) in the three arms. The project has completed the Final Design Review in June 2006. In this status report, the overall concept is summarized and new results on the dichroics, the active flexure compensation system, the operation modes and the expected performance are given. The instrument is being built by a Consortium of Institutes from Denmark, France, Italy and the Netherlands in collaboration with ESO. When in operation, its wide spectral range observing capability will be unique at very large telescopes.},

An example is a cosmic scalar field evolving in a potential, but our treatment is more general. Including this component alters cosmic evolution in a way that fits current observations well. Unlike Lambda, it evolves dynamically and develops fluctuations, leaving a distinctive imprint on the microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {The inflationary prediction of a flat Universe is at odds with current determinations of the matter density (OmegaM~=0.2-0.4). This dilemma can be resolved if a smooth component contributes the remaining energy density (OmegaX=1-OmegaM). We parametrize the smooth component by its equation of state, pX=wrhoX, and show that XCDM with w~=-0.6, OmegaM~=0.3, and h~=0.7 is the best fit to all present cosmological data. Together, the position of the peak in the CMB angular power spectrum and the type Ia supernova magnitude-redshift diagram provide a crucial test of XCDM.},

	Abstract = {We combine high-redshift Type Ia supernovae from the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) with other supernova (SN) samples, primarily at lower redshifts, to form a high-quality joint sample of 472 SNe (123 low-z, 93 SDSS, 242 SNLS, and 14 Hubble Space Telescope). SN data alone require cosmic acceleration at >99.999% confidence, including systematic effects. For the dark energy equation of state parameter (assumed constant out to at least z = 1.4) in a flat universe, we find w = -0.91+0.16 -0.20(stat)+0.07 -0.14(sys) from SNe only, consistent with a cosmological constant. Our fits include a correction for the recently discovered relationship between host-galaxy mass and SN absolute brightness. We pay particular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using a systematic covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence of these effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships. Unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic terms on the empirical light-curve models. The total systematic uncertainty is dominated by calibration terms. We describe how the systematic uncertainties can be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby and intermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated onto USNO/SDSS-like systems.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {The Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) is a five-year survey being carried out at the Las Campanas Observatory to obtain high-quality light curves of ~100 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a well-defined photometric system. Here we present the first release of photometric data that contains the optical light curves of 35 SNe Ia, and near-infrared light curves for a subset of 25 events. The data comprise 5559 optical (ugriBV) and 1043 near-infrared (Y JHKs ) data points in the natural system of the Swope telescope. Twenty-eight SNe have pre-maximum data, and for 15 of these, the observations begin at least 5 days before B maximum. This is one of the most accurate data sets of low-redshift SNe Ia published to date. When completed, the CSP data set will constitute a fundamental reference for precise determinations of cosmological parameters, and serve as a rich resource for comparison with models of SNe Ia.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at the Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

@article{Li:2011a,
	Abstract = {This is the second paper of a series in which we present new measurements of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175 SNe, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find significant fractions of SNe II-L (10 per cent), IIb (12 per cent) and IIn (9 per cent) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more 'standard' with smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 d. We also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for different SN subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a strong correlation between the SN LFs and the host-galaxy size, but there might be a preference for SNe IIn to occur in small, late-type spiral galaxies. The LFs in different inclination bins do not provide strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies, though the sample is still small. The LFs of different SN subclasses show significant differences. We also find that SNe Ibc and IIb come from more luminous galaxies than SNe II-P, while SNe IIn come from less luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The limitations and applications of our LFs are also discussed.},

We show that if a mass-transfer phase on a thermal timescale precedes a nuclear-burning driven phase, then such systems (of which the supersoft X-ray sources are a subgroup) can account for about 10% of the inferred SNe Ia rate. In addition, we examine the cosmic history of the supernova rate and show that the ratio of the rate of SNe Ia to the rate of supernovae produced by massive stars (supernovae of Types II, Ib, Ic) should increase from about z = 1 toward lower redshifts.},

	Abstract = {Models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are reviewed. It is shown that there are strong reasons to believe that most SNe Ia represent thermonuclear disruptions of C-O white dwarfs, when these white dwarfs reach the Chandrasekhar limit and ignite carbon at their centers. Different progenitor scenarios are reviewed critically and the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario are presented in detail. It is argued that theoretical considerations currently favor single-degenerate models, in which the white dwarf accretes from a subgiant or giant companion. However, it is still possible that more than one progenitor class contributes to the observed sample. The relation of the different models to the use of SNe Ia for the determination of cosmological parameters is discussed. It is shown that while the observed diversity of SNe Ia may argue for the existence of different progenitor classes, this does not affect the interpretation of an accelerating expansion of the universe. Crucial observational tests of the conclusions are suggested.},

@article{Meng:2011,
	Abstract = {Context. When type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were chosen as distance indicators to measure cosmological parameters, the Phillips relation was applied. However, the origin of the scatter in the maximum luminosity of SNe Ia (or the variation in the production of 56Ni) remains unclear. Both the metallicity in general and the carbon abundance of a white dwarf (WD) before a supernova explosion are important parameters, but neither has the ability to interpret the scatter in the maximum luminosity of SNe Ia.  Aims: We attempt to check whether or not the carbon abundance can be affected by initial metallicity.  Methods: We calculated a series of stellar evolution models with various masses and metallicities.  Results: We found that when Z <= 0.02, the carbon abundance is almost independent of metallicity if it is plotted against the initial WD mass. However, when Z > 0.02, the carbon abundance is not only a function of the initial WD mass, but also metallicity, i.e. for a given initial WD mass, the higher the metallicity, the lower the carbon abundance. On the basis of some previous studies, i.e. which find that both a high metallicity and a low carbon abundance lead to a lower production of 56Ni being formed during a SN Ia explosion, the effects of the carbon abundance and the metallicity on the amount of 56Ni are enhanced by each other, which may account, at least qualitatively, for the variation in the maximum luminosity of SNe Ia.  Conclusions: Since the central density of WD before a supernova explosion may also play a role in the production of 56Ni and the parameters (the carbon abundance, the metallicity, and the central density) are all determined by the initial parameters of the progenitor system, i.e. the initial WD mass, metallicity, orbital period and secondary mass, the amount of 56Ni might be a function of the initial parameters. Then, our results might construct a bridge linking the progenitor model to the explosion model of SNe Ia.  Appendix is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

@article{Bravo:2010,
	Abstract = {The recognition that the metallicity of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitors might bias their use for cosmological applications has led to an increasing interest in its role in shaping SNIa light curves. We explore the sensitivity of the synthesized mass of 56Ni, M(56Ni), to the progenitor metallicity starting from pre-main-sequence models with masses M 0 = 2-7 M sun and metallicities Z = 10-5-0.10. The interplay between convective mixing and carbon burning during the simmering phase eventually raises the neutron excess, eta, and leads to a smaller 56Ni yield, but does not change substantially the dependence of M(56Ni) on Z. Uncertain attributes of the progenitor white dwarf, like the central density, have a minor effect on M(56Ni). Our main results are: (1) a sizeable amount of 56Ni is synthesized during incomplete Si-burning, which leads to a stronger dependence of M(56Ni) on Z than obtained by assuming that 56Ni is produced in material that burns fully to nuclear statistical equilibrium; (2) in one-dimensional delayed detonation simulations a composition dependence of the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) density gives a nonlinear relationship between M(56Ni) and Z and predicts a luminosity larger than previously thought at low metallicities (however, the progenitor metallicity alone cannot explain the whole observational scatter of SNIa luminosities); and (3) an accurate measurement of the slope of the Hubble residuals versus metallicity for a large enough data set of SNIa might give clues to the physics of DDT in thermonuclear explosions.},

@article{Garavini:2004,
	Abstract = {We present an extensive new time series of spectroscopic data of the peculiar SN 1999aa in NGC 2595. Our data set includes 25 optical spectra between -11 and +58 days with respect to B-band maximum light, providing an unusually complete time history. The early spectra resemble those of an SN 1991T-like object but with a relatively strong Ca H and K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si II lambda6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day -7, and its velocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum light. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than in SN 1991T, suggesting SN 1999aa as a possible link between SN 1991T-like and Branch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra, doubly ionized Fe, Si, and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are characteristic of SN 1991T-like objects. Furthermore, in the day -11 spectrum, evidence is found for an absorption feature that could be identified as high velocity C II lambda6580 or Halpha. At the same epoch C III lambda4648.8 at photospheric velocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 {\AA}. High-velocity Ca is found around maximum light together with Si II and Fe II confined in a narrow velocity window. Implied constraints on supernovae progenitor systems and explosion hydrodynamic models are briefly discussed.},

@article{Gal-Yam:2009,
	Abstract = {Stars with initial masses such that 10<=Minitial<=100, where  is the solar mass, fuse progressively heavier elements in their centres, until the core is inert iron. The core then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an explosion-an iron-core-collapse supernova. By contrast, extremely massive stars with Minitial>=140 (if such exist) develop oxygen cores with masses, Mcore, that exceed 50, where high temperatures are reached at relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs before oxygen ignition and leads to a violent contraction which triggers a nuclear explosion that unbinds the star in a pair-instability supernova. Transitional objects with 100<Minitial<140 may end up as iron-core-collapse supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps as a result of brief episodes of pair instability, and may already have been identified. Here we report observations of supernova SN2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving object located within a dwarf galaxy. We estimate the exploding core mass to be Mcore~100, in which case theory unambiguously predicts a pair-instability supernova. We show that >3 of radioactive 56Ni was synthesized during the explosion and that our observations are well fitted by models of pair-instability supernovae. This indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic stellar mass limit, which perhaps result from processes similar to those that created the first stars in the Universe.},

	Abstract = {If, in addition to the usual luminosity correction described by the light curve slope parameter b, we introduce a color correction parameter R, then an extraordinarily good fit is realized for all the 29 distant Type Ia supernovae of the recent Calacutea n/Tololo supernova survey. The reduced chi (2) found is much lower than can be expected. All of the intrinsic dispersion is thereby removed from the data sample, leaving perfectly standardized candles insofar as one can measure with present techniques. The best-fit solution has a mysteriously low value for R (referred to the B-band) of about 2 and a value of b ~ 0.5 which is smaller than previously reported without the color correction. These parameters lead, using pre-Hipparcos distances for Cepheid calibrations, to essentially the same value for the Hubble constant. Our preliminary value, subject to further investigation of Cepheid-calibrated supernovae using this same color correction, is H{0 = 60 +/- 6 \ kms(-1) Mpc(-1}) .

To perform the survey, the DES Collaboration is building the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square degree, 520 Megapixel CCD camera that will be mounted at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. CCD production has finished, yielding roughly twice the required 62 2kx4k detectors. The construction of DECam is nearly finished; some components have already been received at CTIO. In addition, the DES Collaboration has been evaluating the physics prospects and design options of the Dark Energy Survey Upgrade, for which the instrument is a multi-fiber spectrometer, called DESpec. This poster will concentrate on the present status of DECam and the expected start of survey operations and show initial concepts for DESpec.},

@article{Riess:2001,
	Abstract = {We present photometric observations of an apparent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at a redshift of ~1.7, the farthest SN observed to date. The supernova, SN 1997ff, was discovered in a repeat observation by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N) and serendipitously monitored with NICMOS on HST throughout the Thompson et al. Guaranteed-Time Observer (GTO) campaign. The SN type can be determined from the host galaxy type: an evolved, red elliptical lacking enough recent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse supernovae. The classification is further supported by diagnostics available from the observed colors and temporal behavior of the SN, both of which match a typical SN Ia. The photometric record of the SN includes a dozen flux measurements in the I, J, and H bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. The redshift derived from the SN photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with the redshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from the U300B450V606I814J110J125H160H165Ks photometry of the galaxy. Optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentative spectroscopic redshift of 1.755. Fits to observations of the SN provide constraints for the redshift-distance relation of SNe Ia and a powerful test of the current accelerating universe hypothesis. The apparent SN brightness is consistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferred cosmological model, OmegaM~1/3,OmegaLambda~2/3. It is inconsistent with gray dust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astrophysical effects that could mimic previous evidence for an accelerating universe from SNe Ia at z~0.5. We consider several sources of potential systematic error, including gravitational lensing, supernova misclassification, sample selection bias, and luminosity calibration errors. Currently, none of these effects alone appears likely to challenge our conclusions. Additional SNe Ia at z>1 will be required to test more exotic alternatives to the accelerating universe hypothesis and to probe the nature of dark energy. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Ruiter:2009,
	Abstract = {We analyze the evolution of binary stars to calculate synthetic rates and delay times of the most promising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) progenitors. We present and discuss evolutionary scenarios in which a white dwarf (WD) reaches the Chandrasekhar mass and potentially explodes in a SNe Ia. We consider Double Degenerate (DDS; merger of two WDs), Single Degenerate (SDS; WD accreting from H-rich companion), and AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn; WD accreting from He-rich companion) scenarios. The results are presented for two different star formation histories: burst (elliptical-like galaxies) and continuous (spiral-like galaxies). It is found that delay times for the DDS in our standard model (with common envelope efficiency alphaCE = 1) follow a power-law distribution. For the SDS we note a wide range of delay times, while AM CVn progenitors produce a short burst of SNe Ia at early times. The DDS median delay time falls between ~0.5 and 1 Gyr the SDS between ~2 and 3 Gyr and the AM CVn between ~0.8 and 0.6 Gyr depending on the assumed alphaCE. For a Milky-Way-like (MW-like) galaxy, we estimate the rates of SNe Ia arising from different progenitors as: ~10-4 yr-1 for the SDS and AM CVn, and ~10-3 yr-1 for the DDS. We point out that only the rates for two merging carbon-oxygen WDs, the only systems found in the DDS, are consistent with the observed rates for typical MW-like spirals. We also note that DDS progenitors are the dominant population in elliptical galaxies. The fact that the delay time distribution for the DDS follows a power law implies more SNe Ia (per unit mass) in young rather than in aged populations. Our results do not exclude other scenarios, but strongly indicate that the DDS is the dominant channel generating SNe Ia in spiral galaxies, at least in the framework of our adopted evolutionary models. Since it is believed that WD mergers cannot produce a thermonuclear explosion given the current understanding of accreting WDs, either the evolutionary calculations along with accretion physics are incorrect, or the explosion calculations are inaccurate and need to be revisited.},

	Abstract = {
The W40 complex is a nearby site of recent massive star formation
composed of a dense molecular cloud adjacent to an HII region that
contains an embedded OB star cluster.  The HII region is beginning to
blister out and break free from its envelope of molecular gas, but our
line of sight to the central stars is largely obscured by intervening
dust.  Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible at optical, infrared, or
cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that heats the HII
region. The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a small
number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at
various wavelengths, but the lower mass stellar population remains
largely unexamined. Despite its modest optical appearance, at 600 pc W40
is  one of the nearest massive star forming regions, and with a UV flux
of about 1/10th of the Orion Nebula Cluster, this neglected region
deserves detailed investigation.

	Abstract = {The IfA Deep Survey uncovered ~ 130 thermonuclear supernova (TN SN, i.e., Type Ia) candidates at redshifts from z = 0.1 out to beyond z = 1. The TN SN explosion rates derived from these data have been controversial, conflicting with evidence emerging from other surveys. This work revisits the IfA Deep Survey to re-evaluate the photometric evidence. Applying the SOFT program to the light curves of all SN candidates, we derive new classification grades and redshift estimates. We find a volumetric rate for z ~ 0.5 that is substantially smaller than the originally published values, bringing the revised IfA Deep rate into good agreement with other surveys. With our improved photometric analysis techniques, we are able to confidently extend the rate measurements to higher redshifts and we find a steadily increasing TN SN rate, with no indication of a peak out to z = 1.05.},

	Abstract = {We observed the young open cluster NGC 2301 for 14 nights in 2004 February using the orthogonal transfer CCD camera OPTIC. We used point-spread function shaping techniques (``square stars'') during the observations, allowing us to obtain a larger dynamic range (4.5 mag) of high photometric precision results (<=2 mmag). These results are better than similar observing campaigns using standard CCD imagers. This paper discusses our observational techniques and presents initial results for the variability statistics found in NGC 2301.

	Abstract = {We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a luminous Type IIP Supernova (SN) 2009kf discovered by the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) survey and also detected by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The SN shows a plateau in its optical and bolometric light curves, lasting approximately 70 days in the rest frame, with an absolute magnitude of M  V  = --18.4 mag. The P-Cygni profiles of hydrogen indicate expansion velocities of 9000 km s-1 at 61 days after discovery which is extremely high for a Type IIP SN. SN 2009kf is also remarkably bright in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and shows a slow evolution 10-20 days after optical discovery. The NUV and optical luminosity at these epochs can be modeled with a blackbody with a hot effective temperature (T ~ 16,000 K) and a large radius (R ~ 1 × 1015 cm). The bright bolometric and NUV luminosity, the light curve peak and plateau duration, the high velocities, and temperatures suggest that 2009kf is a Type IIP SN powered by a larger than normal explosion energy. Recently discovered high-z SNe (0.7 < z < 2.3) have been assumed to be IIn SNe, with the bright UV luminosities due to the interaction of SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium. UV-bright SNe similar to SN 2009kf could also account for these high-z events, and its absolute magnitude M NUV = --21.5 $\pm$ 0.5 mag suggests such SNe could be discovered out to z ~ 2.5 in the PS1 survey.},

	Abstract = {From Sloan Digital Sky Survey u'g'r'i'z' imaging, we estimate the stellar masses of the host galaxies of 70 low-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia, 0.015 <z< 0.08) from the hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. These nearby SNe were discovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find that their host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of SNe discovered by the flux-limited Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). Testing four separate light curve fitters, we detect ~2.5sigma correlations of Hubble residuals with both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that SNe Ia occurring in physically larger, more massive hosts are ~10% brighter after light curve correction. The Hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distance modulus to the SN, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curve properties, away from the expected value at the SN redshift. Marginalizing over linear trends in Hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that the correlations cannot be attributed to a light-curve-dependent calibration error. Combining 180 higher-redshift ESSENCE, SNLS, and HigherZ SNe with 30 nearby SNe whose host masses are less than 1010.8 M sun in a cosmology fit yields 1 + w = 0.22+0.152 -0.108, while a combination where the 30 nearby SNe instead have host masses greater than 1010.8 M sun yields 1 + w = -0.03+0.217 -0.143. Progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlate with galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. Host galaxy measurements will yield improved distances to SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {
Large photometric surveys of transient phenomena, such as Panoramic
Survey Telescope &#38; Rapid Response System and Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope, will locate thousands to millions of Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) candidates per year, a rate prohibitive for acquiring spectroscopy
to determine each candidate's type and redshift. In response, we have
developed an economical approach to identifying SNe Ia and their
redshifts using an uncommon type of optical filter which has multiple,
discontinuous passbands on a single substrate. Observation of a
supernova through a specially designed pair of these "cross-correlation
filters" measures the approximate amplitude and phase of the
cross-correlation between the spectrum and a SN Ia template, a quantity
typically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift SN
Ia. Simulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of SNe Ia
which is ~98% pure with individual redshifts measured to sigma<SUB> z
</SUB> = 0.01 precision. The advantages of this approach over standard
broadband photometric methods are that it is insensitive to reddening,
independent of the color data used for subsequent distance
determinations which reduce selection or interpretation bias, and
because it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is
greater. A great advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from
increased throughput, enhanced multiplexing, and reduced setup time
resulting in a net gain in speed of up to ~30 times. This approach is
also insensitive to host galaxy contamination. Prototype filters were
built and successfully used on Magellan with LDSS-3 to characterize
three SuperNova Legacy Survey candidates. We discuss how these filters
can provide critical information for the upcoming photometric supernova
surveys.

	Abstract = {Using light curves and host galaxy spectra of 101 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with redshift z <~ 0.3 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Supernova Survey (SDSS-SN), we derive the SN Ia rate as a function of progenitor age (the delay time distribution, DTD). We use the VESPA stellar population synthesis algorithm to analyze the SDSS spectra of all galaxies in the field searched by SDSS-SN, giving us a reference sample of 77,000 galaxies for our SN Ia hosts. Our method does not assume any a priori shape for the DTD and is therefore minimally parametric. We present the DTD in physical units for high-stretch (luminous, slow declining) and low-stretch (subluminous, fast declining) supernovae in three progenitor age bins. We find strong evidence of two progenitor channels: one that produces high-stretch SNe Ia lsim400 Myr after the birth of the progenitor system, and one that produces low-stretch SNe Ia with a delay gsim2.4 Gyr. We find that each channel contributes roughly half of the Type Ia rate in our reference sample. We also construct the average spectra of high-stretch and low-stretch SN Ia host galaxies, and find that the difference of these spectra looks like a main-sequence B star with nebular emission lines indicative of star formation. This supports our finding that there are two populations of SNe Ia, and indicates that the progenitors of high-stretch supernovae are at the least associated with very recent star formation in the last few tens of Myr. Our results provide valuable constraints for models of Type Ia progenitors and may help improve the calibration of SNe Ia as standard candles.},

@article{Mennekens:2010,
	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the contribution of different formation scenarios for type Ia supernovae in elliptical galaxies. The single-degenerate scenario (a white dwarf accreting from a late main-sequence or red giant companion) is tested against the double-degenerate scenario (the spiral-in and merging of two white dwarfs through the emission of gravitational wave radiation).  Methods: We use a population-number synthesis code that incorporates the latest physical results in binary evolution and allows us to differentiate between certain physical scenarios (e.g. description of common-envelope evolution) and evolutionary parameters (e.g. mass-transfer efficiency during Roche-lobe overflow). The obtained theoretical distributions of the delay times of type Ia supernovae are compared, both in morphological shape and in absolute number of events, to those which are observed. The critical dependency of these distributions on certain parameters is used to constrain the values of the latter.  Results: We find that the single-degenerate scenario alone cannot explain the morphological shape of the observational delay-time distribution, while the double-degenerate scenario (or a combination of both) can. Most of these double-degenerate type Ia supernovae are created through a normal quasi-conservative Roche-lobe overflow followed by a common-envelope phase, not through two successive common-envelope phases. This may cast doubt on the use in other studies of analytical formalisms to determine delay times. In terms of absolute number, theoretical supernova Ia rates in old elliptical galaxies lie a factor of at least three below the observed ones. We propose a solution involving the effect of rotation on the evolution of intermediate mass binaries.},

@article{Kobayashi:2009,
	Abstract = {We construct a new model of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), based on the single degenerate scenario, taking account of the metallicity dependences of white dwarf (WD) wind and the mass-stripping effect on the binary companion star. Our model naturally predicts that SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of 0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the red giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be explained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of the metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the binary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H] lsim-1, e.g., high-z spiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better reproduction of the [(alpha, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar neighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the cosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z ~ 1. At z gsim 1, the predicted SN Ia rate decreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment. This suggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small.},

@article{Chen:2007,
	Abstract = {Recent investigations on the delay time of Type Ia supernovae have set useful constraints on the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. Here we have calculated the evolution of close binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence or subgiant companion. We assume that, once Roche lobe overflow occurs, a small fraction of the lost mass from the system forms a circumbinary disk, which extracts the orbital angular momentum from the system through tidal torques. Our calculations indicate that the existence of a circumbinary disk can enhance the mass transfer rate and cause secular orbital shrinkage. The white dwarf can grow in mass efficiently to trigger Type Ia supernovae even with relatively low mass (<~2 Msolar) donor stars. Thus, this scenario suggests a new possible evolutionary channel to those Type Ia supernovae with long delay times ~1-3 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We have combined the large SN Ia database of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometric redshifts, Very Large Array 1.4 GHz radio sources, and Spitzer infrared sources. We present eight SNe Ia in early-type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radio and infrared source catalogs. We find the SN Ia rate in subsets of radio and infrared early-type galaxies is ~1-5 times the rate in all early-type galaxies, and that any enhancement is always lsim2sigma. Rates in these subsets are consistent with predictions of the two-component "A+B" SN Ia rate model. Since infrared properties of radio SN Ia hosts indicate dust-obscured star formation, we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the "A+B" model. We also show the properties of SNe Ia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hosts contain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions (DTDs) for SNe Ia, although other DTDs cannot be ruled out based on our data.},

	Abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) occur in both old, passive galaxies and active, star-forming galaxies. This fact, coupled with the strong dependence of SN Ia rate on star formation rate, suggests that SNe Ia form from stars with a wide range of ages. Here we show that the rate of SN Ia explosions is about 1% of the stellar death rate, independent of star formation history. The dependence of SN Ia rate on star formation rate implies a delay time distribution proportional to t-0.5+/-0.2. The single-degenerate channel for SNe Ia can be made to match the observed SN Ia rate-SFR relation, but only if white dwarfs are converted to SNe Ia with a uniform efficiency of ~1%, independent of mass. Since low-mass progenitors are expected to have lower conversion efficiencies than high-mass progenitors, we conclude that some other progenitor scenario must be invoked to explain some, or perhaps all, SNe Ia.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae on the basis of our new evolutionary models of single-degenerate (SD) progenitor systems. Our model DTD has almost a featureless power law shape (~t-n with n~1) for the delay time from t~0.1 to 10 Gyr. This is in good agreement with the recent direct measurement of DTDs. The observed featureless property of the DTD has been suggested to be favorable for the double-degenerate (DD) scenario but not for the SD scenario. If the mass range of the companion star to the white dwarf (WD) were too narrow in the SD model, its DTD would be too limited around the companion's main-sequence lifetime to be consistent with the observed DTD. However, this is not the case in our SD model that consists of the two channels of WD+RG (red giant) and WD+MS (main-sequence star). In these channels, the companion stars have a mass range of ~0.9-3 Msolar (WD+RG) and ~2-6 Msolar (WD+MS). The combined mass range is wide enough to yield the featureless DTD. We emphasize that the SD scenario should include two important processes: the optically thick winds from the mass-accreting WD and the mass-stripping from the companion star by the WD wind.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of the first set of low-redshift (z < 0.08) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) monitored by the Carnegie Supernova Project between 2004 and 2006 is presented. The data consist of well-sampled, high-precision optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (NIR; YJHKs ) light curves in a well-understood photometric system. Methods are described for deriving light-curve parameters, and for building template light curves which are used to fit SN Ia data in the ugriBVYJH bands. The intrinsic colors at maximum light are calibrated using a subsample of supernovae (SNe) assumed to have suffered little or no reddening, enabling color excesses to be estimated for the full sample. The optical-NIR color excesses allow the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to be studied. A low average value of the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, RV ≈ 1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of SNe. However, when the two highly reddened SNe (SN 2005A and SN 2006X) in the sample are excluded, a value RV ≈ 3.2 is obtained, similar to the standard value for the Galaxy. The red colors of these two events are well matched by a model where multiple scattering of photons by circumstellar dust steepens the effective extinction law. The absolute peak magnitudes of the SNe are studied in all bands using a two-parameter linear fit to the decline rates and the colors at maximum light, or alternatively, the color excesses. In both cases, similar results are obtained with dispersions in absolute magnitudes of 0.12-0.16 mag, depending on the specific filter-color combination. In contrast to the results obtained from the comparison of the color excesses, these fits of absolute magnitude give RV ≈ 1-2 when the dispersion is minimized, even when the two highly reddened SNe are excluded. This discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellar reddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion in the colors of SNe Ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of the decline rate. Finally, a Hubble diagram for the best-observed subsample of SNe is produced by combining the results of the fits of absolute magnitude versus decline rate and color excess for each filter. The resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to be limited by the peculiar velocities of the host galaxies as evidenced by the strong correlation between the distance-modulus residuals observed in the individual filters. The implication is that the actual precision of SNe Ia distances is 3%-4%.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

@article{Fitzpatrick:2009,
	Abstract = {We combine new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera of Survey with existing data to investigate the wavelength dependence of near-IR (NIR) extinction. Previous studies suggest a power law form for NIR extinction, with a "universal" value of the exponent, although some recent observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may exist. We show that a power-law model for the NIR extinction provides an excellent fit to most extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly from sight line to sight line. Therefore, it seems that a "universal NIR extinction law" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V) ≡ A(V)/E(B - V) tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which have been considered "peculiar" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V) values. We show that the power-law parameters can depend on the wavelength interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths are included. This result implies that extrapolating power-law fits to determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose exponent increases with wavelength, has only two free parameters, can fit all of our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power-law model, it gives R(V)s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 \frac{E(K-V)}{E(B-V)} - 0.79 can estimate R(V) to $\pm$0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations, and demonstrate how large samples of observational quantities can provide useful constraints on the grain properties.},

	Abstract = {
Type Ia supernovae form an observationally uniform class of stellar
explosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates.
This one-parameter behaviour allows type Ia supernovae to be calibrated
as cosmological `standard candles', and led to the discovery of an
accelerating Universe. Recent investigations, however, have revealed
that the true nature of type Ia supernovae is more complicated.
Theoretically, it has been suggested that the initial thermonuclear
sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the white-dwarf
progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the explosion.
Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of type Ia
supernovae beyond the luminosity-decline-rate relation is an unresolved
issue. Here we report that the spectral diversity is a consequence of
random directions from which an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our
findings suggest that the spectral evolution diversity is no longer a
concern when using type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles.
Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from the centre
is a generic feature of type Ia supernovae.

	Abstract = {
Future measurements of the nature of dark energy using Type Ia
supernovae will require a precise characterization of systematic sources
of error. Evolutionary effects remain the most uncertain contributor to
the overall systematic error budget. Present plans to probe evolution
with cosmology-independent explosion parameters could yield an absence
of evidence for evolution without definitive evidence of its absence.
Here we show that observations of Type Ia supernovae in the redshift
interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.0, where dark-energy-dependent effects are
relatively negligible, should provide direct evidence to discern
evolutionary effects. As examples of our approach to constraining
evolution, we examine the impact of changing progenitor metallicity and
age on the degree of potential luminosity evolution. We show that the
observations we propose can be carried out by existing space telescopes,
or ones that are already under development.

	Abstract = {We present a method using the SALT2 light curve fitter to determine the redshift of type Ia supernovae in the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) based on their photometry in g', r', i' and z'. On 289 supernovae of the first three years of SNLS data, we obtain a precision sigmaDelta z/(1+z) = 0.022 on average up to a redshift of 1.0, with a higher precision of 0.016 for z < 0.45 and a lower one of 0.025 for z > 0.45. The rate of events with |Delta z|/(1+z) > 0.15 (catastrophic errors) is 1.4%, and reduces to 0.4% when restricting the test sample of spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae. Both the precision and the rate of catastrophic errors are better than what can be currently obtained using host galaxy photometric redshifts. Photometric redshifts of this precision may be useful for future experiments which aim to discover up to millions of supernovae Ia but without spectroscopy for most of them.},

	Abstract = {
We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high
signal-to-noise Hubble Space Telescope data, and spectra of six SNe Ia
that were discovered during 2001, are presented. Additionally, for the
two SNe with z &gt; 1, we present ground-based J-band photometry from
Gemini and the Very Large Telescope. These are among the most distant
SNe Ia for which ground-based near-IR observations have been obtained.
We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently
become available in the literature to the Union compilation. We have
made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most
important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2
fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new
compilation, consisting of 557 SNe, the Union2 compilation. The flat
concordance LambdaCDM model remains an excellent fit to the Union2
data with the best-fit constant equation-of-state parameter w =
--0.997<SUP>+0.050</SUP>
<SUB>--0.054</SUB>(stat)<SUP>+0.077</SUP>
<SUB>--0.082</SUB>(stat + sys together) for a flat universe, or w =
--1.038<SUP>+0.056</SUP>
<SUB>--0.059</SUB>(stat)<SUP>+0.093</SUP>
<SUB>--0.097</SUB>(stat + sys together) with curvature. We also
present improved constraints on w(z). While no significant change in w
with redshift is detected, there is still considerable room for
evolution in w. The strength of the constraints depends strongly on
redshift. In particular, at z &gt;~ 1, the existence and nature of dark
energy are only weakly constrained by the data.<p/>

Using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
imaging of the GOODS North and South fields during Cycles 11, 12, and
13, we derive empirical constraints on the delay-time distribution
function for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We extend our previous
analysis to the three-year sample of 56 SNe Ia over the range 0.2 &lt; z
&lt; 1.8, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to determine the best-fit
unimodal delay-time distribution function. The test, which ultimately
compares the star formation rate density history to the unbinned
volumetric SN Ia rate history from the GOODS/HST SN survey, reveals a SN
Ia delay-time distribution that is tightly confined to 3-4 Gyr (to
&gt;95% confidence). This result is difficult to resolve with any
intrinsic delay-time distribution function (bimodal or otherwise), in
which a substantial fraction (e.g., &gt;10%) of events are "prompt,"
requiring less than approximately 1 Gyr to develop from formation to
explosion. The result is, however, strongly motivated by the decline in
the number of SNe Ia at z &gt; 1.2. Sub-samples of the HST SN data
confined to lower redshifts (z &lt; 1) show plausible delay-time
distributions that are dominated by prompt events, which is more
consistent with results from low-redshift supernova samples and
supernova host galaxy properties. Scenarios in which a substantial
fraction of z &gt; 1.2 supernovae are extraordinarily obscured by dust
may partly explain the differences in low-z and high-z results. Other
possible resolutions may include environmental dependences (such as
gas-phase metallicity) that affect the progenitor mechanism efficiency,
especially in the early universe.

@article{Hayden:2010,
	Abstract = {
We analyze the rise and fall times of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light
curves discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova
Survey. From a set of 391 light curves k-corrected to the rest-frame B
and V bands, we find a smaller dispersion in the rising portion of the
light curve compared to the decline. This is in qualitative agreement
with computer models which predict that variations in radioactive nickel
yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the decline
rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest
that a single "stretch" correction to the light curve phase does not
properly model the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset
of 105 light curves well observed in both rise and fall portions of the
light curves and develop a "2-stretch" fit algorithm which estimates the
rise and fall times independently. We find the average time from
explosion to B-band peak brightness is 17.38 &#177; 0.17 days, but
with a spread of rise times which range from 13 days to 23 days. Our
average rise time is shorter than the 19.5 days found in previous
studies; this reflects both the different light curve template used and
the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. The SDSS-II supernova set
and the local SNe Ia with well-observed early light curves show no
significant differences in their average rise-time properties. We find
that slow-declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that the
distribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single peaked. This
distribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was
first suggested by Strovink from an analysis of a small set of local SNe
Ia. We divide the SDSS-II sample in half based on the rise minus fall
value, t<SUB>r</SUB> - t<SUB>f</SUB> &lt;= 2 days and
t<SUB>r</SUB> - t<SUB>f</SUB> &gt; 2 days, to search for
differences in their host galaxy properties and Hubble residuals; we
find no difference in host galaxy properties or Hubble residuals in our
sample.

of SN Ia spectra, and will be used in the SNLS 3rd year cosmological
analyses.  <BR />Methods: Spectra have been reduced and extracted with a
dedicated pipeline that uses photometric information from deep CFHT
legacy survey (CFHT-LS) reference images to trace, at sub-pixel
accuracy, the position of the supernova on the spectrogram as a function
of wavelength. It also separates the supernova and its host light in
~60% of cases. The identification of the supernova candidates is
performed using a spectrophotometric SN Ia model.   <BR />Results: A
total of 124 SNe Ia, roughly 50% of the overall SNLS spectroscopic
sample, have been identified using the ESO/VLT during the first three
years of the survey. Their redshifts range from z = 0.149 to z = 1.031.
The average redshift of the sample is z = 0.63&#177;0.02. This
constitutes the largest SN Ia spectral set to date in this redshift
range. The spectra are presented along with their best-fit spectral SN
Ia model and a host model where relevant. In the latter case, a host
subtracted spectrum is also presented. We produce average spectra for
pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z &lt; 0.5 and z
>= 0.5 SNe Ia. We find that z &lt; 0.5 spectra have deeper
intermediate mass element absorptions than z >= 0.5 spectra. The
differences with redshift are consistent with the selection of brighter
and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.<p/>

Modern supernova (SN) surveys are now uncovering stellar explosions at
rates that far surpass what the world's spectroscopic resources can
handle. In order to make full use of these SN data sets, it is necessary
to use analysis methods that depend only on the survey photometry. This
paper presents two methods for utilizing a set of SN light-curve
templates to classify SN objects. In the first case, we present an
updated version of the Bayesian Adaptive Template Matching program
(BATM). To address some shortcomings of that strictly Bayesian approach,
we introduce a method for Supernova Ontology with Fuzzy Templates
(SOFT), which utilizes fuzzy set theory for the definition and
combination of SN light-curve models. For well-sampled light curves with
a modest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N &gt;10), the SOFT method can
correctly separate thermonuclear (Type Ia) SNe from core collapse SNe
with &gt;=98% accuracy. In addition, the SOFT method has the potential
to classify SNe into sub-types, providing photometric identification of
very rare or peculiar explosions. The accuracy and precision of the SOFT
method are verified using Monte Carlo simulations as well as real SN
light curves from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperNova Legacy
Survey. In a subsequent paper, the SOFT method is extended to address
the problem of parameter estimation, providing estimates of redshift,
distance, and host galaxy extinction without any spectroscopy.

The spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7)
galaxy sample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the
original SDSS target selection criteria. We analyse the clustering of
galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy and
main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
data. In total, this sample comprises 893319 galaxies over
9100deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in
power spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us
to constrain the distance-redshift relation at multiple epochs. We
achieve a distance measure at redshift z = 0.275, of
r<SUB>s</SUB>(z<SUB>d</SUB>)/D<SUB>V</SUB>(0.275) = 0.1390 +/- 0.0037
(2.7 per cent accuracy), where r<SUB>s</SUB>(z<SUB>d</SUB>) is the
comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, D<SUB>V</SUB>(z)
&equiv; [(1 +
z)<SUP>2</SUP>D<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>A</SUB>cz/H(z)]<SUP>1/3</SUP>,
D<SUB>A</SUB>(z) is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the Hubble
parameter. We find an almost independent constraint on the ratio of
distances D<SUB>V</SUB>(0.35)/D<SUB>V</SUB>(0.2) = 1.736 +/- 0.065,
which is consistent at the 1.1sigma level with the best-fitting
Lambda cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z = 0.275
distance constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year
(WMAP5) data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses
of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower
significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change
in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using
WMAP5 constraints on Omega<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> and
Omega<SUB>c</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>, and combining our BAO distance
measurements with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight
constraint on Omega<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.286 +/- 0.018 and H<SUB>0</SUB> =
68.2 +/- 2.2kms<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> that is robust to allowing
Omega<SUB>k</SUB> != 0 and w != -1. This result is independent of
the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by
the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets with the
full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints on both
Omega<SUB>k</SUB> = -0.006 +/- 0.008 and w = -0.97 +/- 0.10 for a
constant dark energy equation of state.

	Abstract = {
Although the nature of the progenitor of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is
still unclear, the single-degenerate (SD) channel for the progenitor is
currently accepted, in which a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD)
accretes hydrogen-rich material from its companion, increases its mass
to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, and then explodes as an SN Ia. The
companion may be a main sequence or a slightly evolved star (WD + MS),
or a red giant star (WD + RG). Incorporating the effect of mass
stripping and accretion-disk instability on the evolution of the WD
binary, we carried out binary stellar evolution calculations for more
than 1600 close WD binaries. As a result, the initial parameter spaces
for SNe Ia are presented in an orbital period-secondary mass (log P
<SUB>i</SUB>, M <SUP>i</SUP> <SUB>2</SUB>) plane. We confirmed that in a
WD + MS system, the initial companion leading to SNe Ia may have mass
from 1 M <SUB>sun</SUB> to 5 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. The initial WD mass for
SNe Ia from WD + MS channel is as low as 0.565 M <SUB>sun</SUB>, while
the lowest WD mass from the WD + RG channel is 1.0 M <SUB>sun</SUB>.
Adopting the above results, we studied the birth rate of SNe Ia via a
binary population synthesis approach. We found that the Galactic SNe Ia
birth rate from SD model is (2.55-2.9) &#215; 10<SUP>-3</SUP>
yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (including WD + He star channel), which is slightly
smaller than that from observation. If a single starburst is assumed,
the distribution of the delay time of SNe Ia from the SD model may be a
weak bimodality, where WD + He channel contributes to SNe Ia with delay
time shorter than 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr and WD + RG channel to those with
age longer than 6 Gyr.

	Abstract = {
Constraints on dark energy from current observational data are sensitive
to how distances are measured from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) data. We
find that flux averaging of SNe Ia can be used to test the presence of
unknown systematic uncertainties, and yield more robust distance
measurements from SNe Ia. We have applied this approach to the
nearby+SDSS+ESSENCE+SNLS+HST set of 288 SNe Ia, and the
``Constitution'' set of 397 SNe Ia. Combining the SN Ia data
with cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5 yr observations, the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the data of 69
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) , and the Hubble constant measurement from the
Hubble Space Telescope project SHOES, we measure the dark energy density
function X(z)&equiv;rho<SUB>X</SUB>(z)/rho<SUB>X</SUB>(0) as a free
function of redshift (assumed to be a constant at z&gt;1 or z&gt;1.5).
Without the flux averaging of SNe Ia, the combined data using the
Constitution set of SNe Ia seem to indicate a deviation from a
cosmological constant at &tilde;95% confidence level at
0&lsim;z&lsim;0.8; they are consistent with a cosmological constant at
&tilde;68% confidence level when SNe Ia are flux averaged. The combined
data using the nearby+SDSS+ESSENCE+SNLS+HST data set of SNe Ia are
consistent with a cosmological constant at 68% confidence level with or
without flux averaging of SNe Ia, and give dark energy constraints that
are significantly more stringent than that using the Constitution set of
SNe Ia. Assuming a flat Universe, dark energy is detected at &gt;98%
confidence level for z<=0.75 using the combined data with 288 SNe Ia
from nearby+SDSS+ESSENCE+SNLS+HST, independent of the assumptions about
X(z>=1). We quantify dark energy constraints without assuming a flat
Universe using the dark energy figure of merit for both X(z) and a dark
energy equation-of-state linear in the cosmic scale factor.

	Abstract = {
We discuss the extent to which photometric measurements alone can be
used to identify Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and to determine the redshift
and other parameters of interest for cosmological studies. We fit the
light curve data of the type expected from a survey such as the one
planned with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and also remove
the contamination from the core-collapse SNe to SNIa samples. We
generate 1000 SNIa mock flux data for each of the LSST filters based on
existing design parameters, then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis
to fit the redshift, apparent magnitude, stretch factor, and the phase
of the SNIa. We find that the model fitting works adequately well when
the true SNe redshift is below 0.5, while at z &lt; 0.2 the accuracy of
the photometric data is almost comparable with spectroscopic
measurements of the same sample. We discuss the contamination of Type
Ib/c (SNIb/c) and Type II supernova (SNII) on the SNIa data set. We find
that it is easy to distinguish the SNII through the large
chi<SUP>2</SUP> mismatch when fitting to photometric data with Ia
light curves. This is not the case for SNIb/c. We implement a
statistical method based on the Bayesian estimation in order to
statistically reduce the contamination from SNIb/c for cosmological
parameter measurements from the whole SNe sample. The proposed
statistical method also evaluates the fraction of the SNIa in the total
SNe data set, which provides a valuable guide to establish the degree of
contamination.

	Abstract = {
We present measurements of the Hubble diagram for 103 Type Ia supernovae
(SNe) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first
season (Fall 2005) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II)
Supernova Survey. These data fill in the redshift "desert" between low-
and high-redshift SN Ia surveys. Within the framework of the MLCS2K2
light-curve fitting method, we use the SDSS-II SN sample to infer the
mean reddening parameter for host galaxies, R<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.18
&#177; 0.14<SUB>stat</SUB> &#177; 0.48<SUB>syst</SUB>, and find that
the intrinsic distribution of host-galaxy extinction is well fitted by
an exponential function, P(A<SUB>V</SUB> ) = exp(-A<SUB>V</SUB>
/tau<SUB>V</SUB>), with tau<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.334 &#177; 0.088 mag.
We combine the SDSS-II measurements with new distance estimates for
published SN data from the ESSENCE survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey
(SNLS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and a compilation of Nearby SN
Ia measurements. A new feature in our analysis is the use of detailed
Monte Carlo simulations of all surveys to account for selection biases,
including those from spectroscopic targeting. Combining the SN Hubble
diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the SDSS
Luminous Red Galaxy sample and with cosmic microwave background
temperature anisotropy measurements from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and
Omega<SUB>M</SUB>, assuming a spatially flat cosmological model
(FwCDM) with constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w. We
also consider constraints upon Omega<SUB>M</SUB> and
Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB> for a cosmological constant model
(LambdaCDM) with w = -1 and non-zero spatial curvature. For the
FwCDM model and the combined sample of 288 SNe Ia, we find w =
-0.76 &#177; 0.07(stat) &#177; 0.11(syst), Omega<SUB>M</SUB>
= 0.307 &#177; 0.019(stat) &#177; 0.023(syst) using MLCS2K2 and w =
-0.96 &#177; 0.06(stat) &#177; 0.12(syst), Omega<SUB>M</SUB>
= 0.265 &#177; 0.016(stat) &#177; 0.025(syst) using the SALT-II
fitter. We trace the discrepancy between these results to a difference
in the rest-frame UV model combined with a different luminosity
correction from color variations; these differences mostly affect the
distance estimates for the SNLS and HST SNe. We present detailed
discussions of systematic errors for both light-curve methods and find
that they both show data-model discrepancies in rest-frame U band. For
the SALT-II approach, we also see strong evidence for
redshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta).
Restricting the analysis to the 136 SNe Ia in the Nearby+SDSS-II
samples, we find much better agreement between the two analysis methods
but with larger uncertainties: w = -0.92 &#177;
0.13(stat)<SUP>+0.10</SUP> <SUB>-0.33</SUB>(syst) for MLCS2K2 and
w = -0.92 &#177; 0.11(stat)<SUP>+0.07</SUP>
<SUB>-0.15</SUB> (syst) for SALT-II.

The IFA and collaborators are embarking on a project to develop a

6.5m class telescope envisaged by the decadal review in their proposal
for a LSST, this facility will nonetheless be able to accomplish many of
the LSST science goals. In this paper we will describe the motivation
for a `distributed aperture" approach for the LSST, the current
concept for Pan-STARRS -- a pilot project for the LSST proper -- and its
performance goals and science reach. We will also discuss how the

first of a new generation of dedicated wide-field survey telescopes.
Featuring a 5.7 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field-of-view Cassegrain imager and 268
Mega-pixel CCD array, its primary goal will be to undertake the Southern
Sky Survey: a six colour (uvgriz), six-epoch digital record of the
entire southern sky. The survey will provide photometry for objects
between 8th and 23rd magnitude with a global photometric accuracy of
0.03 magnitudes and astrometry to 50 mas. In this contribution we
introduce the SkyMapper facility, the survey data products and outline a
variety of case-studies in stellar astrophysics for which SkyMapper will
have high impact.

@article{Law:2009,
	Abstract = {
The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field
survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky.
The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera
installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory;
colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the
automated Palomar 60 inch telescope. PTF uses 80% of the 1.2 m and 50%
of the 1.5 m telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches
a depth of m&ap;21.3 and m&ap;20.6 (5sigma, median seeing). Four major
experiments are planned for the five-year project: (1) a 5 day cadence
supernova search; (2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90
s and 1 day; (3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets
in Orion; and (4) a 3pi sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides
automatic, real-time transient classification and follow-up, as well as
a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper
summarizes the PTF project, including several months of on-sky
performance tests of the new survey camera, the observing plans, and the
data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF
optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

@article{Kim:2007,
	Abstract = {
The distance and redshift of a type Ia supernova can be determined
simultaneously through its multi-band light curves. This fact may be
used for imaging surveys that discover and obtain photometry for large
numbers of supernovae; so many that it would be difficult to obtain a
spectroscopic redshift for each. Using available supernova-analysis
tools we find that there are several conditions in which a viable
distance redshift can be determined. Uncertainties in the effective
distance at z&tilde;0.3 are dominated by redshift uncertainties coupled
with the steepness of the Hubble law. By z&tilde;0.5 the Hubble law
flattens out and distance modulus uncertainties dominate. Observations
that give S/N=50 at peak brightness and a four-day observer cadence in
each of griz-bands are necessary to match the intrinsic supernova
magnitude dispersion out to z=1.0. Lower S/N can be tolerated with the
addition of redshift priors (e.g. from a host-galaxy photometric
redshift), observations in an additional redder band, or by focusing on
supernova redshifts that have particular leverage for this measurement.
More stringent S/N requirements are anticipated as improved systematics
control over intrinsic color, metallicity, and dust is attempted to be
drawn from light curves.

Two nearby galaxies, IC 1613 and NGC 6822, were observed over four years
to detect short period Cepheids and to obtain good light curves for
Fourier decomposition. Since the program was carried out with a
relatively small telescope, the Dutch 0.9 m at ESO-La Silla, the
observations were performed without filter (white light), or Wh-band;
the advantage of this technique is that the photon statistics correspond
to those of V-band observations of similar exposure time obtained with a
2-m class telescope. In this paper we discuss some properties of Wh
photometry and present the results of the observations of Field B in IC
1613 (3.8'x3.8'). A total of 65 images were obtained and the reduction
was performed with DAOPHOT. The light curves of 4037 stars were
measured, and the analysis using various techniques allowed the
detection of 121 variable stars. We detected 51 population I Cepheids,
while previously only 12 Cepheids were known in the same field. Most of
these have short periods and some are first overtone mode pulsators. The
other variable stars include one eclipsing binary, two suspected W Vir
stars, 57 irregular and semi-regular red variables, 3 periodic red
variables and 6 irregular blue variables. Based on observations
collected at ESO-La Silla

We apply the image-subtraction method in order to reanalyze the ESO Very
Large Telescope data on M83 (NGC 5236), obtained and analyzed by Thim et
al. Whereas Thim et al. found 12 Cepheids with periods between 12 and 55
days, we find 112 Cepheids with periods ranging from 7 to 91 days as
well as ~60 other variables. These include two candidate eclipsing
binaries, which, if confirmed, would be the first optically discovered
outside the Local Group. We thus demonstrate that the image-subtraction
method is much more powerful for detecting variability, especially in
crowded fields. However, Hubble Space Telescope observations are
necessary to obtain a Cepheid period-luminosity distance not dominated
by blending and crowding. We propose a ``hybrid'' approach, in which
numerous Cepheids are discovered and characterized using large
ground-based telescopes and then followed up with the Hubble Space
Telescope to obtain precise distances.

Using the multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic data covering
the Chandra Deep Field South obtained within the Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey, we investigate the rest-frame UV properties of
galaxies to z~2.2, including the evolution of the luminosity function,
the luminosity density, star formation rate (SFR), and galaxy
morphology. We find a significant brightening (~1 mag) in the rest-frame
2800 &#197; characteristic magnitude (M*) over the redshift range
0.3&lt;~z&lt;~1.7 and no evolution at higher redshifts. The rest-frame
2800 &#197; luminosity density shows an increase by a factor of ~4 over
the redshift range investigated. We estimate the SFR density to z~2.2
from the 1500 and 2800 &#197; luminosities. When no correction for
extinction is made, we find that the SFR derived from the 2800 &#197;
luminosity density is almost a factor of 2 higher than that derived from
the 1500 &#197; luminosities. Attributing this difference to
differential dust extinction, we find that E(B-V)=0.20 results in the
same extinction-corrected SFR from both 1500 and 2800 &#197;
luminosities. The extinction-corrected SFR is a factor of ~6.5 (~3.7)
higher than the uncorrected SFR derived from 1500 &#197; (2800 &#197;)
luminosity. We investigate the morphological composition of our sample
by fitting S&#233;rsic profiles to the HST ACS galaxy images at a
fixed rest-frame wavelength of 2800 &#197; at 0.5&lt;~z&lt;~2.2. We
find that the fraction of apparently bulge-dominated galaxies
(S&#233;rsic index n&gt;2.5) increases from ~10% at z~0.5 to ~30% at
z~2.2. At the same time, we note that galaxies get bluer at increasing
redshift. This suggests a scenario where an increased fraction of the
star formation takes place in bulge-dominated systems at high redshift.
This could be evidence that the present-day elliptical galaxies are a
result of assembly (i.e., mergers) of galaxies at z&gt;~1. Finally, we
find that galaxy size for a luminosity-selected sample evolves as
r<SUB>h</SUB>~(1+z)<SUP>-1.1</SUP> between redshifts z=2.2 and 1.1. This
is consistent with previous measurements and suggests a similar
evolution over the redshift range 0&lt;~z&lt;~6.

Counts-in-cells are measured in the tauCDM Virgo Hubble Volume
simulation. This large N-body experiment has 10<SUP>9</SUP> particles in
a cubic box of size 2000h<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc. The unprecedented combination
of size and resolution allows, for the first time, a realistic numerical
analysis of the cosmic errors and cosmic correlations of statistics
related to counts-in-cells measurements, such as the probability
distribution function P<SUB>N</SUB> itself, its factorial moments
F<SUB>k</SUB> and the related cumulants psi and S<SUB>N</SUB>s. These
statistics are extracted from the whole simulation cube, as well as from
4096 subcubes of size 125h<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc, each representing a virtual
random realization of the local universe. The measurements and their
scatter over the subvolumes are compared to the theoretical predictions
of Colombi, Bouchet &#38; Schaeffer for P<SUB>0</SUB>, and of Szapudi
&#38; Colombi and Szapudi, Colombi &#38; Bernardeau for the factorial
moments and the cumulants. The general behaviour of experimental
variance and cross-correlations as functions of scale and order is well
described by theoretical predictions, with a few per cent accuracy in
the weakly non-linear regime for the cosmic error on factorial moments.
On highly non-linear scales, however, all variants of the hierarchical
model used by SC and SCB to describe clustering appear to become
increasingly approximate, which leads to a slight overestimation of the
error, by about a factor of two in the worst case. Because of the needed
supplementary perturbative approach, the theory is less accurate for
non-linear estimators, such as cumulants, than for factorial moments.
The cosmic bias is evaluated as well, and, in agreement with SCB, is
found to be insignificant compared with the cosmic variance in all
regimes investigated. While higher order statistics were previously
evaluated in several simulations, this work presents textbook quality
measurements of S<SUB>N</SUB>s, 3&lt;=N&lt;=10, in an unprecedented
dynamic range of 0.05 &lt;~ psi &lt;~ 50. In the weakly non-linear
regime the results confirm previous findings and agree remarkably well
with perturbation theory predictions including the one-loop corrections
based on spherical collapse by Fosalba &#38; Gazta&#241;aga. Extended
perturbation theory is confirmed on all scales.

Colombi et al. (Paper I) investigated the counts-in-cells statistics and
their respective errors in the tauCDM Virgo Hubble Volume simulation.
This extremely large N-body experiment also allows a numerical
investigation of the cosmic distribution function, Upsilon(
A<SUP>~</SUP>), itself for the first time. For a statistic A, Upsilon(
A<SUP>~</SUP>) is the probability density of measuring the value
A<SUP>~</SUP> in a finite galaxy catalogue. Upsilon was evaluated for
the distribution of counts-in-cells, P<SUB>N</SUB>, the factorial
moments, F<SUB>k</SUB>, and the cumulants, psi<SUP>-</SUP> and
S<SUB>N</SUB>s, using the same subsamples as Paper I. While Paper I
concentrated on the first two moments of Upsilon, i.e. the mean, the
cosmic error and the cross-correlations, here the function Upsilon is
studied in its full generality, including a preliminary analysis of
joint distributions Upsilon( A<SUP>~</SUP>, B<SUP>~</SUP>). The most
significant, and reassuring result for the analyses of future galaxy
data is that the cosmic distribution function is nearly Gaussian
provided its variance is small. A good practical criterion for the
relative cosmic error is that DeltaAA&lt;~0.2. This means that for
accurate measurements, the theory of the cosmic errors, presented by
Szapudi &#38; Colombi and Szapudi, Colombi &#38; Bernardeau, and
confirmed empirically by Paper I, is sufficient for a full statistical
description and thus for a maximum likelihood rating of models. As the
cosmic error increases, the cosmic distribution function Upsilon
becomes increasingly skewed and is well described by a generalization of
the lognormal distribution. The cosmic skewness is introduced as an
additional free parameter. The deviation from Gaussianity of Upsilon(
F<SUP>~</SUP><SUB>k</SUB>) and Upsilon( S<SUP>~</SUP><SUB>N</SUB>)
increases with order k, N and similarly for Upsilon(
P<SUP>~</SUP><SUB>N</SUB>) when N is far from the maximum of
P<SUB>N</SUB>, or when the scale approaches the size of the catalogue.
For our particular experiment, Upsilon( F<SUP>~</SUP><SUB>k</SUB>) and
Upsilon( psi<SUP>-~</SUP>) are well approximated with the standard
lognormal distribution, as evidenced by both the distribution itself and
the comparison of the measured skewness with that of the lognormal
distribution.

	Abstract = {
Cosmic variance is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the
volume density of extragalactic objects such as galaxies or quasars
arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This is
often a significant source of uncertainty, especially in deep galaxy
surveys, which tend to cover relatively small areas. We present
estimates of the relative cosmic variance for one-point statistics
(i.e., number densities) for typical scales and volumes sampled by the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). We use two approaches:
(1) For objects with a known two-point correlation function that is well
approximated by a power law, one can use the standard analytic formalism
to calculate the cosmic variance (in excess of shot noise). We use this
approach to estimate the cosmic variance for several populations that
are being studied in the GOODS program (extremely red objects [EROs] at
z~1 and Lyman break galaxies [LBGs] at z~3 and z~4) using clustering
information for similar populations in the literature. (2) For
populations with unknown clustering, one can use predictions from cold
dark matter theory to obtain a rough estimate of the variance as a
function of number density. We present a convenient plot that allows one
to use this approach to read off the cosmic variance for a population
with a known mean redshift and estimated number density. We conclude
that for the volumes sampled by GOODS, cosmic variance is a significant
source of uncertainty for strongly clustered objects (~40%-60% for EROs)
and less serious for less clustered objects (~10%-20% for LBGs).

The final fate of massive stars depends on many factors. Theory suggests
that some with initial masses greater than 25 to 30 solar masses end up
as Wolf-Rayet stars, which are deficient in hydrogen in their outer
layers because of mass loss through strong stellar winds. The most
massive of these stars have cores which may form a black hole and theory
predicts that the resulting explosion of some of them produces ejecta of
low kinetic energy, a faint optical luminosity and a small mass fraction
of radioactive nickel. An alternative origin for low-energy supernovae
is the collapse of the oxygen-neon core of a star of 7-9 solar masses.
No weak, hydrogen-deficient, core-collapse supernovae have hitherto been
seen. Here we report that SN2008ha is a faint hydrogen-poor supernova.
We propose that other similar events have been observed but have been
misclassified as peculiar thermonuclear supernovae (sometimes labelled
SN2002cx-like events). This discovery could link these faint supernovae
to some long-duration gamma-ray bursts, because extremely faint,
hydrogen-stripped core-collapse supernovae have been proposed to produce
such long gamma-ray bursts, the afterglows of which do not show
evidence of associated supernovae.

Optical spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova SN 2002ic obtained on 2003
June 27.6 UT, i.e., ~222 rest-frame days after explosion, is presented.
Strong H emission indicates an interaction between the expanding SN
ejecta and an H-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The spectrum of SN
2002ic resembles those of SNe 1997cy and 1999E. The three SNe also have
similar luminosities, suggesting that they are the same phenomenon and
that the CSM is also similar. We propose a new classification, Type IIa
SNe, for these events. The observed line profiles and line ratios are
measured and discussed within the ejecta-CSM interaction scenario. The
emission in H Balmer, [O III], and He I lines, and in permitted Fe II
blends, resembles the spectra of the Type IIn SN 1987F and of Seyfert 1
galaxies. A high-density, clumpy CSM is inferred. Strong, very broad [Ca
II]/Ca II and [O I]/O I emissions imply that not all the outer SN ejecta
were decelerated in the interaction, suggesting that the CSM is
aspherical.

Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with the death of
metal-poor massive stars. Even though they are highly transient events
very hard to localize, they are so bright that they can be detected in
the most difficult environments. GRB observations are unveiling a
surprising view of the chemical state of the distant universe (redshifts
z&gt;2). Contrary to what is expected for a high-z metal-poor star, the
neutral interstellar medium (ISM) around GRBs is not metal poor
(metallicities vary from ~ 1/10 solar at z = 6.3 to about solar at z =
2) and is enriched with dust (90 99% of iron is in solid form). If these
metallicities are combined with those measured in the warm ISM of GRB
host galaxies at z&lt;1, a redshift evolution is observed. Such an
evolution predicts that the stellar masses of the hosts are in the range
M* = 10<SUP>8.6 9.8</SUP>M<SUB>odot</SUB>. This prediction makes use of
the mass-metallicity relation (and its redshift evolution) observed in
normal star-forming galaxies. Independent measurements coming from the
optical NIR (near-infrared) photometry of GRB hosts indicate the same
range of stellar masses, with a typical value similar to that of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This newly detected population of
intermediate-mass galaxies is very hard to find at high redshift using
conventional astronomy. However, it offers a compelling and relatively
inexpensive opportunity to explore galaxy formation and cosmic chemical
evolution beyond known borders, from the primordial universe to the
present.

In this paper, we present and discuss a new Monte Carlo approach aimed
at correcting the observed supernova (SN) rates for the effects of host
galaxy dust extinction. The problem is addressed in a general way and
the model includes SN position distributions, SN light-curve and
spectral library and dust properties and distribution as input
ingredients. Even though the recipe we propose is in principle
applicable to all SN types, in this paper, we illustrate the use of our
model only for Type Ia. These represent, in fact, the simplest test
case, basically due to their spectroscopic homogeneity, which to a first
approximation allows one to treat them all in the same way. This test
case shows that the final results do not depend critically on the spiral
arm dust geometry, while the total amount of dust, its properties and
the size of the Galactic bulge do have a strong effect. With the
availability of more complete spectral libraries and a more accurate
knowledge of SN spatial distribution, the method we propose here can be
easily extended to core collapse events.

Damped Lymanalpha systems (DLAs) and sub-DLAs seen towards background
quasars provide the most detailed probes of elemental abundances.
Somewhat paradoxically these measurements are more difficult at lower
redshifts due to the atmospheric cut-off, and so a few years ago our
group began a program to study abundances at z &lt; 1.5 in quasar
absorbers. In this paper, we present new Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle
Spectrograph (UVES) observations of six additional quasar
absorption-line systems at z &lt; 1.5, five of which are sub-DLAs. We
find solar or above solar metallicity, as measured by the abundance of
zinc, assumed not to be affected by dust, in two sub-DLAs: one, towards
Q0138-0005 with [Zn/H] = +0.28 +/- 0.16; the other towards Q2335+1501
with [Zn/H] = +0.07 +/- 0.34. Relatively high metallicity was observed
in another system: Q0123-0058 with [Zn/H] = -0.45 +/- 0.20. Only for the
one DLA in our sample, in Q0449-1645, do we find a low metallicity,
[Zn/H] = -0.96 +/- 0.08. We also note that in some of these systems
large relative abundance variations from component to component are
observed in Si, Mn, Cr and Zn.<p/>

European Southern Observatory with UVES on the 8.2-m KUEYEN telescope

We report on spectroscopic observations with the Multiple Mirror
Telescope for 11 damped Lyalpha absorbers (DLAs) or strong DLA
candidates at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.5, including several absorbers discovered in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In particular, we have measured absorption
lines of Zn II, Cr II, Ni II, Fe II, Mn II, Ti II, Ca II, and Si II.
These measurements have doubled the sample of Zn and Cr measurements at
z&lt;1. The average relative abundance patterns in these objects are
very similar to those found for high-redshift DLAs reported in the
literature. Our observations suggest that the dust content, as
determined by [Cr/Zn], does not show much change with redshift. We also
examine the sample for correlation of [Cr/Zn] with estimates of the
quasar reddening. Our data suggest that the global mean metallicity of
DLAs, as measured by the gas-phase abundance of Zn, at best shows a weak
evolution with redshift over the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;3.9.

The Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems are absorption line systems
observed toward QSO lines of sight and probe the interstellar medium in
galaxies from the local Universe up to the z ~4 Universe. The large
amount of high resolution QSO spectroscopy that is available now allows
us to measure the metallicity in these galaxies and track the redshift
evolution. We have collected line measurements of 69 DLAs in the
redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 4.4, measured the abundances for different
elements, corrected for dust depletion, and studied the redshift
distribution. We have found that the whole sample shows a strong
correlation with redshift (99.99% significance level), indicating that
these galaxies are chemically evolving with time. We also have found
that the distribution of low HI column density DLAs is much more
homogeneous than the high HI column density DLAs, the latter being more
concentrated in the central redshift interval. As a consequence, the
total sample cannot be used to study the global metallicity evolution in
the Universe, assumed to be given by the ratio of the total metal
content to the total gas content in a given redshift bin, because the
underlining evolution might be masked by the incompleteness of the high
HI column density DLA sample. In conclusion, even if we have
demonstrated that the metallicity in DLA galaxies evolves, the
statistics of DLAs is too poor to probe the global metallicity evolution
of the Universe.<p/>

The goal of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS) is to study an unbiased
sample of K&lt;20.6 galaxies in the redshift range 0.8&lt;z&lt;2.0. Here
we determine the statistical properties of the heavy-element enrichment
in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a subsample of 13 galaxies with
1.34&lt;z&lt;1.97 and UV absolute magnitude M<SUB>2000</SUB>&lt;-19.65.
The sample contains 38% of the total number of identified galaxies in
the first two fields of the survey with z&gt;1.3. The selected objects
have colors typical of irregular and Sbc galaxies. Strong [O II]
emission indicates high star formation activity in the H II regions
(star formation rate ~13-106 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). The
high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum shows strong ISM Mg II and
Fe II absorption, together with weak Mn II and Mg I lines. The Fe II
column density, derived using the curve of growth analysis, is
logN<SUB>FeII</SUB>=15.54<SUP>+0.23</SUP><SUB>-0.13</SUB>. This is
considerably larger than typical values found in damped Lyalpha
systems (DLAs) along QSO sight lines, where only 10 of 87 (~11%) have
logN<SUB>FeII</SUB>&gt;=15.2. High Fe II column densities are observed
in the z=2.72 Lyman break galaxy cB58 (logN<SUB>FeII</SUB>~=15.25) and
in gamma-ray burst host galaxies (logN<SUB>FeII</SUB>~14.8-15.9). Given
our measured Fe II column density and assuming a moderate iron dust
depletion (delta<SUB>Fe</SUB>~1 dex), we derive an optical dust
extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB>~0.6. If the H I column density is
logN<SUB>HI</SUB>&lt;21.7 (as in 98% of DLAs), then the mean metallicity
is Z/Z<SUB>solar</SUB>&gt;0.2. The high completeness of the GDDS sample
implies that these results are typical of star-forming galaxies in the
1&lt;z&lt;2 redshift range, an epoch that has heretofore been
particularly challenging for observational programs.<p/>

We present results of our investigation into the metallicity historyof
disk galaxies between redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;3. Theory predicts that
metallicitychanges less rapidly than star formation rate as a function
of redshift, but until now, there has been no observational foundation
for the metallicity history of star-forming galaxies. Our local
comparison samples include the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS) and an
objectively selected sample of galaxy pairs. We find that the central
metallicities in close pairs are affected by gas flows triggered by an
interaction. We compare the metallicity properties of our local field
galaxies with a large sample of galaxiesfrom the GOODS Field North and
the Lyman Break Galaxies. In our preliminary analysis, we observe
metallicity evolution of 0.15 dex per unit redshift.

Context: The chemical composition of the gas in galaxies over cosmic
time provides a very important tool for understanding galaxy evolution.
Although there are many studies at high redshift, they are rather scarce
at lower redshifts. However, low redshift studies can provide important
clues about the evolution of galaxies, furnishing the required link
between the local and high redshift universe. In this work, we focus on
the metallicity of the gas of star-forming galaxies at low redshift,
looking for signs of chemical evolution.  Aims: We aim to analyze the
metallicity contents star-forming galaxies of similar luminosities and
masses at different redshifts. With this purpose, we present a study of
the metallicity of relatively massive (log(M_star/M<SUB>o</SUB>)
&gsim; 10.5) star forming galaxies from SDSS-DR5 (Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-data release 5), using different redshift intervals from 0.04 to
0.4.  Methods: We used data processed with the STARLIGHT spectral
synthesis code, correcting the fluxes for dust extinction, estimating
metallicities using the R<SUB>23</SUB> method, and segregating the
samples with respect to the value of the [N ii] lambda6583/[O ii]
lambda3727 line ratio in order to break the R<SUB>23</SUB> degeneracy
selecting the upper branch. We analyze the luminosity and
mass-metallicity relations, and the effect of the Sloan fiber diameter
looking for possible biases.  Results: By dividing our redshift samples
in intervals of similar magnitude and comparing them, significant signs
of metallicity evolution are found. Metallicity correlates inversely
with redshift: from redshift 0 to 0.4 a decrement of ~0.1 dex in 12 +
log(O/H) is found.

We present an integrated study of star formation and galactic stellar
mass assembly from z=0.05 to 1.5 and galactic metallicity evolution from
z=0.05 to 0.9 using a very large and highly spectroscopically complete
sample selected by rest-frame NIR bolometric flux in the GOODS-N. We
assume a Salpeter IMF and fit Bruzual &#38; Charlot models to compute
the galactic stellar masses and extinctions. We determine the expected
formed stellar mass density growth rates produced by star formation and
compare them with the growth rates measured from the formed stellar mass
functions by mass interval. We show that the growth rates match if the
IMF is slightly increased from the Salpeter IMF at intermediate masses
(~10 M<SUB>solar</SUB>). We investigate the evolution of galaxy color,
spectral type, and morphology with mass and redshift and the evolution
of mass with environment. We find that applying extinction corrections
is critical when analyzing galaxy colors; e.g., nearly all of the
galaxies in the green valley are 24 mum sources, but after correcting
for extinction, the bulk of the 24 mum sources lie in the blue cloud.
We find an evolution of the metallicity-mass relation corresponding to a
decrease of 0.21+/-0.03 dex between the local value and the value at
z=0.77 in the 10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> range.
We use the metallicity evolution to estimate the gas mass of the
galaxies, which we compare with the galactic stellar mass assembly and
star formation histories. Overall, our measurements are consistent with
a galaxy evolution process dominated by episodic bursts of star
formation and where star formation in the most massive galaxies
(&gt;~10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) ceases at z&lt;1.5 because of
gas starvation.<p/>

Relatively uniform light curves and spectral evolution of Type Ia
supernovae(SNe Ia) have led to the use of SNe Ia as a ``standard
candle'' to determine cosmological parameters. Whether a statistically
significant value of the cosmological constant can be obtained depends
on whether the peak luminosities of SNe Ia are sufficiently free from
the effects of cosmic and galactic evolutions. Here we first review the
single degenerate scenario for the Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD)
models of SNe Ia. We identify the progenitor's evolution and population
with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near
main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In these channels, the strong wind
from accreting WDs plays a key role, which yields important age and
metallicity effects on the evolution. We then address the questions
whether the nature of SNe Ia depends systematically on environmental
properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor system and
whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We suggest that the
variation of the carbon mass fraction X(C) in the C+O WD (or the
variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness
of SNe Ia. This model can explain the observed dependences of SNe Ia
brightness on the galaxy types and the distance from the galactic
center. Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN
Ia progenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate
history as a composite of the supernova rates in different types of
galaxies. .

@article{Kobayashi:1998,
	Abstract = {
We introduce a metallicity dependence of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
rate into the Galactic and cosmic chemical evolution models. In our SN
Ia progenitor scenario, the accreting white dwarf (WD) blows a strong
wind to reach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. If the iron abundance of the
progenitors is as low as [Fe/H] &lt;~ -1, then the wind is too weak for
SNe Ia to occur. Our model successfully reproduces the observed chemical
evolution in the solar neighborhood. We make the following predictions
that can test this metallicity effect:(1) SNe Ia are not found in the
low iron abundance environments such as dwarf galaxies and the outskirts
of spirals. (2) The cosmic SN Ia rate drops at z~1-2 because of the low
iron abundance, which can be observed with the Next Generation Space
Telescope. At z&gt;~1-2 , SNe Ia can be found only in the environments
where the timescale of metal enrichment is sufficiently short as in
starburst galaxies and elliptical galaxies. The low-metallicity
inhibition of SNe Ia can shed new light on the following issues: (1) The
limited metallicity range of the SN Ia progenitors would imply that
"evolution effects" are relatively small for the use of high-redshift
SNe Ia to determine the cosmological parameters. (2) WDs of halo
populations are poor producers of SNe Ia, so that the WD contribution to
the halo mass is not constrained from the iron abundance in the halo.
(3) The abundance patterns of globular clusters and field stars in the
Galactic halo lack of SN Ia signatures in spite of their age difference
of several Gyr, which can be explained by the low-metallicity inhibition
of SNe Ia. (4) It could also explain why the SN Ia contamination is not
seen in the damped Ly alpha systems over a wide range of redshift.

@article{Hachisu:1999,
	Abstract = {
As a promising channel to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we have proposed
a symbiotic binary system consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a
low-mass red giant (RG) in which strong winds from the accreting WD play
a key role increasing the WD mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit.
However, the occurrence frequency of SNe Ia through this channel is
still controversial. Here we propose two new evolutionary processes that
make the symbiotic channel to SNe Ia much wider. (1) We first show that
the WD+RG close binary can form from a wide binary even with an initial
separation as large as a_i&lt;~40,000 R_solar. Such a binary consists of
a low-mass main-sequence (MS) star and an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
star that is undergoing a superwind before becoming a WD. If the
superwind at the end of AGB evolution is as fast as or slower than the
orbital velocity, the wind outflowing from the system takes away the
orbital angular momentum effectively. As a result the wide binary
shrinks greatly to become a close binary. Then the AGB star undergoes to
form a common envelope (CE) evolution. After the CE evolution, the
binary becomes a pair consisting of a carbon-oxygen WD and an MS star.
When the MS star evolves to an RG, a WD+RG system is formed. Therefore,
the WD+RG binary can form from much wider binaries than our earlier
estimate, which was constrained by a_i&lt;~1500 R_solar. (2) When the RG
fills its inner critical Roche lobe, the WD undergoes rapid mass
accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. Our earlier analysis
has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this wind only when
the mass ratio of the RG to the WD is smaller than 1.15. Our new finding
is that the WD wind can strip mass from the RG envelope, which could be
efficient enough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the RG-to-WD
mass ratio exceeds 1.15. If this mass-stripping effect is strong enough,
though its efficiency is subject to uncertainties, the symbiotic channel
can produce SNe Ia for a much (10 or more times) wider range of the
binary parameters than our earlier estimate predicted. With the above
two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel can account for the
inferred rate of SNe Ia in our Galaxy. The immediate progenitor binaries
in this symbiotic channel to SNe Ia may be observed as symbiotic stars,
luminous supersoft X-ray sources, or recurrent novae, such as T CrB or
RS Oph, depending on the wind status.

Aims. Our aim is to show how different hypotheses about type Ia
supernova progenitors can affect Galactic chemical evolution. Supernovae
Ia are believed to be the main producers of Fe and the timescale with
which Fe is restored into the interstellar medium depends on the assumed
supernova progenitor model. This is a way of selecting the most
appropriate progenitor model for supernovae Ia, a still debated issue.
Methods: We include different type Ia SN progenitor models, identified
by their distribution of time delays, in a very detailed chemical
evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the evolution of several
chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the double
degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more
empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions.
Results: We find that assuming the single degenerate or the double
degenerate scenario produces negligible differences in the predicted
[O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the other hand, assuming a percentage of
prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr) type Ia supernovae of 50%, or
that the maximum type Ia rate is reached after 3-4 Gyr from the
beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors, produces
more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread
still existing in the observational data, no model can be firmly
excluded on the basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when
the predictions of the different models are compared with the G-dwarf
metallicity distribution, the scenarios with very few prompt type Ia
supernovae can be excluded.  Conclusions: Models including the single
degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage of 10-13% of
prompt type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement with
the observations. A fraction of prompt type Ia supernovae larger than
30% worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no
prompt type Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical
models for the type Ia SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without
prompt type Ia supernovae and the one assuming a delay time distribution
that is &prop;t<SUP>-0.5</SUP>. We conclude that the typical timescale
for the Fe enrichment in the Milky Way is around 1-1.5 Gyr and that type
Ia supernovae already should appear during the halo phase.

@article{Li:2008,
	Abstract = {
The current Swift sample of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with measured
redshifts allows us to test the assumption that GRBs trace star
formation in the Universe. Some authors have claimed that the rate of
GRBs increases with cosmic redshift faster than the star formation rate,
whose cause is not yet known. In this paper, I investigate the
possibility of interpreting the observed discrepancy between the GRB
rate history and the star formation rate history using cosmic
metallicity evolution. I am motivated by the observation that cosmic
metallicity evolves with redshift and GRBs tend to occur in
low-metallicity galaxies. First, I derive a star formation history up to
redshift z = 7.4 from an updated sample of star formation rate
densities. This is obtained by adding the new ultraviolet measurements
of Bouwens et al. and the new ultraviolet and infrared measurements of
Reddy et al. to the existing sample compiled by Hopkins &#38; Beacom.
Then, adopting a simple model for the relation between GRB production
and the cosmic metallicity history as proposed by Langer &#38; Norman, I
show that the observed redshift distribution of the Swift GRBs can be
reproduced with good accuracy. Although the results are limited by the
small size of the GRB sample and the poorly understood selection biases
in detection and localization of GRBs and in redshift determination,
they suggest that GRBs trace both star formation and metallicity
evolution. If the star formation history can be accurately measured with
other approaches, which is presumably achievable in the near future, it
will be possible to determine the cosmic metallicity evolution using the
study of the redshift distribution of GRBs.

We use the StarTrack population synthesis code to discuss potential
progenitor models of SNe Ia: the single-degenerate scenario, the
semidetached double white dwarf binary, and the double-degenerate
scenario. Using the most recent calculations of accretion onto white
dwarfs, we consider SN Ia explosions of various white dwarfs in binary
systems. We calculate the evolutionary delay times from the zero-age
main sequence to the explosion and verify which scenarios can satisfy
the constraints found by Strolger et al., i.e., a delay time of 2-4 Gyr.
It is found that the semidetached double white dwarf binary model is
inconsistent with observations. Only SN Ia progenitors in the
double-degenerate scenario are compatible with observations in all
tested evolutionary models, with a characteristic delay time of ~3 Gyr.
If double-degenerate mergers are excluded as SN Ia progenitors, we find
that the single-degenerate scenario may explain the observed delay times
for models with low common-envelope efficiency. It is also noted that
the delay time distributions within the various tested SN Ia scenarios
vary significantly and can potentially be used as an additional
constraint on progenitor models.

We use all available deep optical ACS and near-IR data over both the
HUDF and the two GOODS fields to search for star-forming galaxies at
z&gt;~7 and constrain the UV LF within the first 700 Myr. Our data set
includes ~23 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> of deep NICMOS J+H data and ~248
arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> of ground-based (ISAAC+MOIRCS) data, coincident with
ACS optical data of greater or equal depths. In total, we find eight
~7.3 z-dropouts in our search fields, but no z~9 J-dropout candidates. A
careful consideration of a wide variety of different contaminants
suggest an overall contamination level of just ~12% for our z-dropout
selection. After performing detailed simulations to accurately estimate
the selection volumes, we derive constraints on the UV LFs at z~7 and
z~9. For a faint-end slope alpha=-1.74, our most likely values for
M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB> and phi* at z~7 are -19.8+/-0.4 mag and
1.1<SUP>+1.7</SUP><SUB>-0.7</SUB>&#215;10<SUP>-3</SUP>
Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. Our search results for z~9 J-dropouts
set a 1 sigma lower limit on M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB> of -19.6 mag
assuming that phi* and alpha are the same as their values at
slightly later times. This lower limit on M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB> is
1.4 mag fainter than our best-fit value at z~4, suggesting that the UV
LF has undergone substantial evolution over this time period. No
evolution is ruled out at 99% confidence from z~7 to z~6 and at 80%
confidence from z~9 to z~7. We find that the mass-to-light ratio of
halos evolves as ~(1+z)<SUP>-1</SUP> if we require that the observed
brightening in M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB> with redshift [i.e.,
M<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB>=(-21.02+/-0.09)+(0.36+/-0.08)(z-3.8)] be
consistent with the expected evolution in the halo mass function.
Finally, we consider the shape of the UV LF at z&gt;~5 and discuss the
implications of the Schechter-like form of the observed LFs,
particularly the unexpected abrupt cutoff at the bright end.<p/>

Using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6
galaxies from two deep ACS GTO fields with deep optical-IR imaging. A
total of 23 objects are found over 46 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>, or ~0.5+/-0.1
objects arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP> down to z<SUB>AB</SUB>~27.3 (6 sigma), or
a completeness-corrected ~0.5+/-0.2 objects arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP> down to
z<SUB>AB</SUB>~26.5 (including one probable z~6 active galactic
nucleus). Combining deep ISAAC data for our RDCS 1252-2927 field
(J<SUB>AB</SUB>~25.7 and K<SUB>s,AB</SUB>~25.0 5 sigma) and NICMOS
data for the Hubble Deep Field-North (J<SUB>110,AB</SUB> and
H<SUB>160,AB</SUB>~27.3, 5 sigma), we verify that these dropouts have
relatively flat spectral slopes, as one would expect for star-forming
objects at z~6. Compared with the average-color (beta=-1.3) U-dropout
in the Steidel et al. z~3 sample, i-dropouts in our sample range in
luminosity from ~1.5L<SUB>*</SUB> (z<SUB>AB</SUB>~25.6) to
~0.3L<SUB>*</SUB> (z<SUB>AB</SUB>~27.3) with the exception of one very
bright candidate at z<SUB>850,AB</SUB>~24.2. The half-light radii vary
from 0.09" to 0.21", or 0.5 kpc to 1.3 kpc. We derive the z~6 rest-frame
UV luminosity density (or star formation rate density) by using three
different procedures. All three procedures use simulations based on a
slightly lower redshift (z~5) V<SUB>606</SUB>-dropout sample from
Chandra Deep Field-South ACS images. First, we make a direct comparison
of our findings with a no-evolution projection of this V-dropout sample,
allowing us to automatically correct for the light lost at faint
magnitudes or lower surface brightnesses. We find 23%+/-25% more
i-dropouts than we predict, consistent with no strong evolution over
this redshift range. Adopting previous results to z~5, this works out to
a mere 20%+/-29% drop in the luminosity density from z~3 to z~6. Second,
we use the same V-dropout simulations to derive a detailed selection
function for our i-dropout sample and compute the UV-luminosity density
[(7.2+/-2.5)&#215;10<SUP>25</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>
Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> down to z<SUB>AB</SUB>~27]. We find a 39%+/-21% drop
over the same redshift range (z~3-6), consistent with the first
estimate. This is our preferred value and suggests a star formation rate
of 0.0090+/-0.0031 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> to

Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> by extrapolating the luminosity function to the faint
limit, assuming alpha=-1.6. Third, we follow a very similar procedure,
except that we assume no incompleteness, and find a rest-frame continuum
luminosity that is ~2-3 times lower than our other two determinations.
This final estimate is to be taken as a lower limit and is important if
there are modest changes in the colors or surface brightnesses from z~5
to z~6 (the other estimates assume no large changes in the intrinsic
selectability of objects). We note that all three estimates are well
within the canonical range of luminosity densities necessary for
reionization of the universe at this epoch by star-forming galaxies.<p/>

We use all available fields with deep NICMOS imaging to search for
J<SUB>110</SUB>-dropouts (H<SUB>160,AB</SUB>&lt;~28) at z~10. Our
primary data set for this search is the two
J<SUB>110</SUB>+H<SUB>160</SUB> NICMOS fields taken in parallel with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). The 5
sigma limiting magnitudes were ~28.6 in J<SUB>110</SUB> and ~28.5 in
H<SUB>160</SUB> (0.6" apertures). Several shallower fields were also
used: J<SUB>110</SUB>+H<SUB>160</SUB> NICMOS frames available over the
Hubble Deep Field (HDF) North, the HDF-South NICMOS parallel, and the
ACS UDF (with 5 sigma limiting magnitudes in J<SUB>110</SUB> and
H<SUB>160</SUB> ranging from 27.0 to 28.2). The primary selection
criterion was (J<SUB>110</SUB>-H<SUB>160</SUB>)<SUB>AB</SUB>&gt;1.8.
Eleven such sources were found in all search fields using this
criterion. Eight of these are clearly ruled out as credible z~10
sources, either as a result of detections (&gt;2 sigma) blueward of
J<SUB>110</SUB> or their colors redward of the break
(H<SUB>160</SUB>-K~1.5) (redder than &gt;~98% of lower redshift
dropouts). The nature of the three remaining sources could not be
determined from the data. This number appears consistent with the
expected contamination from low-redshift interlopers. Analysis of the
stacked images for the three candidates also suggests some
contamination. Regardless of their true redshifts, the actual number of
z~10 sources must be three or fewer. To assess the significance of these
results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 B-dropout and z~6 i-dropout
sample) were projected to z~7-13 using a (1+z)<SUP>-1</SUP> size scaling
(for fixed luminosity). They were added to the image frames and the
selection was repeated, giving 15.6 and 4.8 J<SUB>110</SUB>-dropouts,
respectively. This suggests that to the limit of this probe
(~0.3L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>z=3</SUB>), there has been evolution from z~3.8
and possibly from z~6. This is consistent with the strong evolution
already noted at z~6 and z~7.5 relative to z~3-4. Even assuming that
three sources from this probe are at z~10, the rest-frame continuum UV
(~1500 &#197;) luminosity density at z~10 (integrated down to
0.3L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>z=3</SUB>) is just
0.19<SUP>+0.13</SUP><SUB>-0.09</SUB> times that at z~3.8 (or
0.19<SUP>+0.15</SUP><SUB>-0.10</SUB> times, including the small effect
from cosmic variance). However, if none of our sources are at z~10, this
ratio has a 1 sigma upper limit of 0.07.<p/>

The evolution of high-redshift galaxies in the two Hubble Deep Fields,
HDF-N and HDF-S, is investigated using a cloning technique that
replicates z~2-3 U dropouts to higher redshifts, allowing a comparison
with the observed B and V dropouts at higher redshifts (z~4-5). We treat
each galaxy selected for replication as a set of pixels that are
k-corrected to higher redshift, accounting for resampling, shot noise,
surface-brightness dimming, and the cosmological model. We find evidence
for size evolution (a 1.7-fold increase) from z~5 to 2.7 for flat
geometries (Omega<SUB>M</SUB>+Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=1.0). Simple
scaling laws for this cosmology predict that size evolution scales as
(1+z)<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with our result. The UV luminosity
density shows a similar increase (&#215;1.85) from z~5 to 2.7, with
minimal evolution in the distribution of intrinsic colors for the
dropout population. In general, these results indicate less evolution
than was previously reported, and therefore a higher luminosity density
at z~4-5 (~50% higher) than other estimates. We argue that the present
technique is the preferred way to understand evolution across samples
with differing selection functions, the most relevant difference here
being the color cuts and surface brightness thresholds [e.g., due to the
(1+z)<SUP>4</SUP> cosmic surface brightness dimming effect].

We investigate the photometric properties of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)
at z=3.5-5.2 based on large samples of 2600 LBGs detected in deep
(i<SUP>'</SUP>&lt;~27) and wide-field (1200 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>) images
taken in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) and the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep
Field (SXDF) using broadband B, V, R, i', and z' filters. The selection
criteria for the LBG samples are examined with 85 spectroscopically
identified objects, and the completeness and contamination of the
samples are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations based on a
photometric-redshift catalog of the Hubble Deep Field-North. We find
that these LBG samples are nearly rest-frame UV magnitude-limited
samples, missing systematically only 10% of red high-z galaxies (in
number), which are a dusty population with E(B-V)&gt;~0.4. We calculate
luminosity functions (LFs) of the LBGs with the estimated completeness
and contamination and find (1) that the number density of bright
galaxies (M<SUB>1700</SUB>&lt;-22 ; corresponding to SFR&gt;~100
h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> with
extinction correction) decreases significantly from z=4 to 5 and (2)
that the faint-end slope of the LFs of LBGs may become steeper toward
higher redshifts. We estimate the dust extinction of z~=4 LBGs with
M&lt;M<SUP>*</SUP> (~=-21) from UV-continuum slopes and obtain
E(B-V)=0.15+/-0.03 as the mean value. The dust extinction remains
constant with apparent luminosity but increases with intrinsic (i.e.,
extinction-corrected) luminosity. We find no evolution in dust
extinction between LBGs at z=3 and 4. We investigate the evolution of
UV-luminosity density by integrating the LFs of LBGs and find that the
UV-luminosity density at 1700 &#197;, rho<SUB>UV</SUB>, does not
significantly change from z=3 to 5, i.e.,
rho<SUB>UV</SUB>(z=4)/rho<SUB>UV</SUB>(z=3)=1.0+/-0.2 and
rho<SUB>UV</SUB>(z=5)/rho<SUB>UV</SUB>(z=3)=0.8+/-0.4 thus, the
cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density (with correction for dust
extinction) remains constant within the error bars, or possibly has a
slight decline, from z=3 to 5. We estimate the stellar mass density from
the cosmic SFR thus obtained and find that this stellar mass density is
consistent with those derived directly from the stellar mass function at
z=0-1 but exceeds those at z~3 by a factor of 3. We find that the ratio
of the UV-luminosity density of Lyalpha emitters (LAEs) to that of
LBGs is ~=60% at z~=5, and thus about half of star formation probably
occurs in LAEs at z~=5. We obtain a constraint on the escape fraction of
UV ionizing photons (i.e., UV continuum in 900 &#197;) produced by
LBGs, f<SUB>esc</SUB>&gt;~0.13. This implies that the escape fraction of
LBGs may be larger than that of star-forming galaxies at z=0.<p/>

We determine the abundance of i'-band dropouts in the recently released
HST/ACS Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF). Because the majority of these
sources are likely to be z~ 6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the
F775W i'-band and F850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-alpha absorption,
the number of detected candidates provides a valuable upper limit to the
unextincted star formation rate at this redshift. We demonstrate that
the increased depth of UDF enables us to reach an 8sigma limiting
magnitude of z'<SUB>AB</SUB>= 28.5 (equivalent to
1.5h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> at z=
6.1, or 0.1L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>UV</SUB> for the z~ 3U-drop population),
permitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved
form of the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one
star) at z'<SUB>AB</SUB> &lt; 28.5 with (i'-z')<SUB>AB</SUB> &gt; 1.3
over the deepest 11-arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> portion of the UDF. The
characteristic luminosity (L<SUP>*</SUP>) is consistent with values
observed at z~ 3. The faint end slope (alpha) is less well
constrained, but is consistent with only modest evolution. The main
change appears to be in the number density (Phi*). Specifically, and
regardless of possible contamination from cool stars and lower-redshift
sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the star
formation rate at z~ 6 was approximately six times less than at z~ 3.
This declining comoving star formation rate
[0.005h<SUB>70</SUB>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> at
z~ 6 at L<SUB>UV</SUB> &gt; 0.1L<SUP>*</SUP> for a Salpeter initial mass
function (IMF)] poses an interesting challenge for models which suggest
that L<SUB>UV</SUB> &gt; 0.1L<SUP>*</SUP> star-forming galaxies at z~= 6
reionized the Universe. The short-fall in ionizing photons might be
alleviated by galaxies fainter than our limit, or a radically different
IMF. Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at
z&gt;&gt; 6.

We present optical (UBVRI) and near-IR (YJHK) photometry of the normal
Type Ia supernova (SN) 2004S. We also present eight optical spectra and
one near-IR spectrum of SN 2004S. The light curves and spectra are
nearly identical to those of SN 2001el. This is the first time we have
seen optical and IR light curves of two Type Ia SNe match so closely.
Within the one parameter family of light curves for normal Type Ia SNe,
that two objects should have such similar light curves implies that they
had identical intrinsic colors and produced similar amounts of
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni. From the similarities of the light-curve shapes we
obtain a set of extinctions as a function of wavelength that allows a
simultaneous solution for the distance modulus difference of the two
objects, the difference of the host galaxy extinctions, and
R<SUB>V</SUB>. Since SN 2001el had roughly an order of magnitude more
host galaxy extinction than SN 2004S, the value of
R<SUB>V</SUB>=2.15<SUP>+0.24</SUP><SUB>-0.22</SUB> pertains primarily to
dust in the host galaxy of SN 2001el. We have also shown via Monte Carlo
simulations that adding rest-frame J-band photometry to the complement
of BVRI photometry of Type Ia SNe decreases the uncertainty in the
distance modulus by a factor of 2.7. A combination of rest-frame optical
and near-IR photometry clearly gives more accurate distances than using
rest-frame optical photometry alone.<p/>

Dark energy appears to be the dominant component of the physical
Universe, yet there is no persuasive theoretical explanation for its
existence or magnitude. The acceleration of the Universe is, along with
dark matter, the observed phenomenon that most directly demonstrates
that our theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either
incorrect or incomplete. Most experts believe that nothing short of a
revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics will be required
to achieve a full understanding of the cosmic acceleration. For these
reasons, the nature of dark energy ranks among the very most compelling
of all outstanding problems in physical science. These circumstances

	Abstract = {
In order to make useful comparisons of different dark energy
experiments, it is important to choose the appropriate figure of merit
(FoM) for dark energy constraints. Here we show that for a set of dark
energy parameters {f<SUB>i</SUB>}, it is most intuitive to define
FoM=1/detf Cov(f<SUB>1</SUB>,f<SUB>2</SUB>,f<SUB>3</SUB>,...),
where Cov(f<SUB>1</SUB>,f<SUB>2</SUB>,f<SUB>3</SUB>,...) is the
covariance matrix of {f<SUB>i</SUB>}. In order for this FoM to represent
the dark energy constraints in an optimal manner, the dark energy
parameters {f<SUB>i</SUB>} should have clear physical meaning and be
minimally correlated. We demonstrate two useful choices of
{f<SUB>i</SUB>} using 182 SNe Ia (from the HST/GOODS program, the first
year Supernova Legacy Survey, and nearby SN Ia surveys),
[R(z<SUB>*</SUB>),l<SUB>a</SUB>(z<SUB>*</SUB>),Omega<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>]
from the five year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations,
and Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of the baryon acoustic
oscillation scale, assuming the Hubble Space Telescope prior of
H<SUB>0</SUB>=72&#177;8(km/s)Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, and without assuming
spatial flatness. We find that for a dark energy equation of state
linear in the cosmic scale factor a, the correlation of
(w<SUB>0</SUB>,w<SUB>0.5</SUB>) [w<SUB>0</SUB>=w<SUB>X</SUB>(z=0),
w<SUB>0.5</SUB>=w<SUB>X</SUB>(z=0.5), with
w<SUB>X</SUB>(a)=3w<SUB>0.5</SUB>-2w<SUB>0</SUB>+3(w<SUB>0</SUB>-w<SUB>0.5</SUB>)a]
is significantly smaller than that of (w<SUB>0</SUB>,w<SUB>a</SUB>)
[with w<SUB>X</SUB>(a)=w<SUB>0</SUB>+(1-a)w<SUB>a</SUB>]. In order to
obtain model-independent constraints on dark energy, we parametrize the
dark energy density function
X(z)=rho<SUB>X</SUB>(z)/rho<SUB>X</SUB>(0) as a free function with
X<SUB>0.5</SUB>, X<SUB>1.0</SUB>, and X<SUB>1.5</SUB> [values of X(z) at
z=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5] as free parameters estimated from data. If one
assumes a linear dark energy equation of state, current observational
data are consistent with a cosmological constant at 68% C.L. If one
assumes X(z) to be a free function parametrized by
(X<SUB>0.5</SUB>,X<SUB>1.0</SUB>,X<SUB>1.5</SUB>), current data deviate
from a cosmological constant at z=1 at 68% C.L., but are consistent with
a cosmological constant at 95% C.L. Future dark energy experiments will
allow us to dramatically increase the FoM of constraints on
(w<SUB>0</SUB>,w<SUB>0.5</SUB>), and of
(X<SUB>0.5</SUB>,X<SUB>1.0</SUB>,X<SUB>1.5</SUB>). This will
significantly shrink the dark energy parameter space to either enable
the discovery of dark energy evolution, or the conclusive evidence for a
cosmological constant.

An explanation is given of the low value of
R<SUB>lambda</SUB>&equiv;A<SUB>lambda</SUB>/E(B-V), the ratio of
absolute to selective extinction deduced from Type Ia supernova
observations. The idea involves scattering by dust clouds located in the
circumstellar environment or at the highest velocity shells of the
supernova ejecta. The scattered light tends to reduce the effective
R<SUB>lambda</SUB> in the optical but has an opposite effect in the
ultraviolet. The presence of circumstellar dust can be tested by
ultraviolet to near-infrared observations and by multiepoch

The effective extinction law for supernovae surrounded by circumstellar
dust is examined with Monte Carlo simulations. Grains with light
scattering properties as for interstellar dust in the Milky Way (MW) or
the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC), but surrounding the explosion site,
would cause a semidiffusive propagation of light up to the edge of the
dust shell. Multiple scattering of photons predominantly attenuates
photons with shorter wavelengths, thus steepening the effective
extinction law as compared to the case of single scattering in the
interstellar medium. Our simulations yield typical values for the
total-to-selective extinction ratio R<SUB>V</SUB>~1.5-2.5, as seen in
recent studies of Type Ia supernova colors, with a steepening
differential extinction toward shorter wavelengths.

In the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using
a variety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematic
uncertainties. Owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics
differing from those of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Type
II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are unlikely to be affected by
evolution in the same way. Based on a new analysis of 17 SNe II-P,
and on an improved methodology, we find that SNe II-P are good
standardizable candles, almost comparable to SNe Ia. We derive a
tight Hubble diagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the
simple correlation between luminosity and photospheric velocity
introduced by Hamuy and Pinto. We show that the descendent method of
Nugent et al. can be further simplified and that the correction for
dust extinction has low statistical impact. We find that our SN sample
favors, on average, a very steep dust law with total to selective
extinction R<SUB>V</SUB> &lt; 2. Such an extinction law has been
recently inferred for many SNe Ia. Our results indicate that a
distance measurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a
SN II-P during the plateau phase combined with sparse photometric
measurements.

components and equations of state of the energy density. We consider the
ability to distinguish between various dynamical scalar field models for
the dark energy, as well as higher dimension and alternate gravity

We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a
spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h<SUP>-3</SUP>
Gpc<SUP>3</SUP> over 3816 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47, making
it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a
well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc
separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and
location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations
on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates
the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between
z~1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard
cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by
which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to
4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5%
accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure
the matter density Omega<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> to 8% and find
agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB
acoustic scale, we find
Omega<SUB>m</SUB>=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w<SUB>0</SUB>)+0.137Omega<SUB>K</SUB>.
Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is
Omega<SUB>K</SUB>=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological
constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of
cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a
geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave
background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly
passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.

	Abstract = {
A modification to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equation is proposed in
which the universe is flat, matter dominated, and accelerating. An
additional term, which contains only matter or radiation (no vacuum
contribution), becomes the dominant driver of expansion at a late epoch
of the universe. During the epoch when the new term dominates, the
universe accelerates; we call this period of acceleration the Cardassian
era. The universe can be flat and yet consist of only matter and
radiation, and still be compatible with observations. The energy density
required to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard
cosmology, so that matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry.
The new term required may arise, e.g., as a consequence of our
observable universe living as a 3-dimensional brane in a
higher-dimensional universe. The Cardassian model survives several
observational tests, including the cosmic background radiation, the age
of the universe, the cluster baryon fraction, and structure formation.

We address the issue of whether extra dimensions could have an infinite
volume and yet reproduce the effects of observable four-dimensional
gravity on a brane. There is no normalizable zero-mode graviton in this
case, nevertheless correct Newton's law can be obtained by exchanging
bulk gravitons. This can be interpreted as an exchange of a single
metastable 4D graviton. Such theories have remarkable phenomenological
signatures since the evolution of the Universe becomes high-dimensional
at very large scales. Furthermore, the bulk supersymmetry in the
infinite volume limit might be preserved while being completely broken
on a brane. This gives rise to a possibility of controlling the value of
the bulk cosmological constant. Unfortunately, these theories have
difficulties in reproducing certain predictions of Einstein's theory
related to relativistic sources. This is due to the van
Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the propagator of a massive
graviton. This suggests that all theories in which contributions to
effective 4D gravity come predominantly from the bulk graviton exchange
should encounter serious phenomenological difficulties.

We use the new Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-II supernova survey, together with additional supernova data sets
as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background and baryon
acoustic oscillations to constrain cosmological models. This complements
the standard cosmology analysis presented by Kessler et al. in that we
discuss and rank a number of the most popular nonstandard cosmology
scenarios. When this combined data set is analyzed using the MLCS2k2
light-curve fitter, we find that more exotic models for cosmic
acceleration provide a better fit to the data than the LambdaCDM
model. For example, the flat Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model is ranked
higher by our information-criteria (IC) tests than the standard model
with a flat universe and a cosmological constant. When the supernova
data set is instead analyzed using the SALT-II light-curve fitter, the
standard cosmological-constant model fares best. This investigation of
how sensitive cosmological model selection is to assumptions about, and
within, the light-curve fitters thereby highlights the need for an
improved understanding of these unresolved systematic effects. Our
investigation also includes inhomogeneous Lema&#238;tre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) models. While our LTB models can be made to fit the supernova data
as well as any other model, the extra parameters they require are not
supported by our IC analysis. Finally, we explore more model-independent
ways to investigate the cosmic expansion based on this new data set.

In the course of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I), a large fraction
of the surveyed area was observed more than once due to field tiling
overlap, usually at different epochs. We utilize some of these data to
perform a supernova (SN) survey at a mean redshift of z = 0.2. Our
archival search, in ~5 per cent of the SDSS-I overlap area, produces 29
SN candidates clearly associated with host galaxies. Using the Bayesian
photometric classification algorithm of Poznanski et al., and correcting
for classification bias, we find 17 of the 29 candidates are likely Type
Ia SNe. Accounting for the detection efficiency of the survey and for
host extinction, this implies a Type Ia SN rate of r<SUB>Ia</SUB> =
(14.0<SUP>+2.5+1.4</SUP><SUB>-2.5-1.1</SUB> +/- 2.5) &#215;
10<SUP>-14</SUP>h<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>L<SUP>-1</SUP><SUB>solar,g</SUB>,
where the errors are Poisson error, systematic detection efficiency
error and systematic classification error, respectively. The volumetric
rate is R<SUB>Ia</SUB> = (1.89<SUP>+0.42+0.18</SUP><SUB>-0.34-0.15</SUB>
+/- 0.42) &#215;
10<SUP>-5</SUP>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>h<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>.
Our measurement is consistent with other rate measurements at low
redshift. An order of magnitude increase in the number of SNe is
possible by analysing the full SDSS-I data base.

@phdthesis{Strolger:2003,
	Abstract = {
Over 2200 supernova events have been discovered in the past
millenium---nearly half of which have been found in only the last
decade. The rise in interest in these events has been sparked, in large
part, by the sample of distant Type Ia supernovae which are giving
unprecedented information about the cosmological parameters of our
Universe. However, when one considers that very little is known about
several SN Types including the Type Ia events, it is clear that there
remains much to be understood in the detailed analysis of supernovae.
Currently, this analysis is best done through relatively low redshift
supernova surveys. Here I present the results from the Nearby Galaxies
Supernova Search project (NGSS), a three-year survey for SNe in
equatorial field galaxies. Through the bulk analysis of these SNe, I
have determined the local SN rates in field galaxies (in Supernova Units
[SNu]; Supernovae per century per 10<SUP>10</SUP>
L<SUB>B<SUB>o</SUB></SUB> ) to be 0.192 &#177; 0.045 (Poisson)
&#177; 0.094 (systematic) for Type Ia SNe, 0.678 &#177; 0.164
&#177; 0.278 to 1.242 &#177; 0.301 &#177; 0.514 for Type II SNe,
and 1.166 &#177; 0.178 &#177; 0.498 to 1.924 &#177; 0.293 &#177;
0.887 for all supernova types (depending on assumed intrinsic extinction
distributions for core-collapse events). A small number of SNe from this
survey were also attributed to Abell galaxy clusters. Although there was
not a sufficient sample in which to draw conclusive rates, through
simple assumptions about galaxy cluster mass, size, and luminosity
parameters, I estimate the supernova rate to be 0.46 &#177; 0.14
(Poisson) to 0.84 &#177; 0.26 SNu in these environments (also
dependent on extinction distributions). In the course of this survey, we
discovered a number of rare SN types, including SN 1999aw, a SN
1999aa-like Type Ia in a very low-luminosity host galaxy. We have
completed a very thorough analysis of this luminous and peculiar event,
which I include in this dissertation. The NGSS project has successfully
discovered one of the largest samples of SNe from a complete CCD-based
survey of field galaxies. Further detailed analysis our data will
produce very well sampled multipassband lightcurves, accurately
determined SN types from early epoch spectra, and correlation studies of
SN types with host galaxy environments.

The high-redshift star formation rate (SFR) is difficult to measure
directly even by modern approaches. Long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) can be detected to the edge of the visible universe because of
their high luminosities. The collapsar model of long GRBs indicates that
they may trace the star formation history. So, long GRBs may be a useful
tool of measuring the high-redshift SFR. Observations show that long
GRBs prefer to form in a low-metallicity environment. We study the
high-redshift SFR up to z ~ 8.3 considering the Swift GRBs tracing the
star formation history and the cosmic metallicity evolution in different
background cosmological models including Lambda cold dark matter
(LambdaCDM), quintessence, quintessence with a time-varying equation
of state and brane-world model. We use latest Swift GRBs including two
highest-z GRBs, GRB 080913 at z = 6.7 and GRB 090423 at z = 8.3. We find
that the SFR at z &gt; 4 shows a steep decay with a slope of ~-5.0 in
LambdaCDM. In the other three models, the high-redshift SFR is
slightly different from LambdaCDM model and also shows a steep decay.

The determination of the star-formation history of the Universe is a key
goal of modern cosmology, as it is crucial to our understanding of how
galactic structures form and evolve. Observations of young stars in
distant galaxies at different times in the past have indicated that the
stellar birthrate peaked some eight billion years ago before declining
by a factor of around ten to its present value. Here we report an
analysis of the `fossil record' of the current stellar populations of
96,545 nearby galaxies, from which we obtained a complete star-formation
history. Our results broadly support those derived from high-redshift
galaxies. We find, however, that the peak of star formation was more
recent-around five billion years ago. We also show that the bigger the
stellar mass of the galaxy, the earlier the stars were formed, which
indicates that high- and low-mass galaxies have very different
histories.

The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to
fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at
lambda&gt;5 mum and the galaxy counts from various surveys at
mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of
evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number
counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by
current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield
approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous
galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic
background at lambda&gt;200 mum is quite sensitive to the evolution
at high redshift, i.e., z&gt;1, all models that fit the counts require a
flattening at z~0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the
140 mum CIRB is produced at 0&lt;z&lt;1.5, while only about 30% of the
850 mum background is produced within the same redshift range. The
nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the
dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of
redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet
surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1,
much sooner than previously thought, with a value of
0.25<SUP>+0.12</SUP><SUB>-0.1</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>
Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, and remains almost constant up to z~2. At least 70% of
this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with
L<SUB>IR</SUB>&gt;10<SUP>11</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>. The long-wavelength
observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly
trace the evolution at z&gt;2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR
density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts.
However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from
extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the
Lyman break galaxy population at z~3 suggests that the almost flat
comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a
redshift of z~4.

	Abstract = {
The evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy
star formation rate (SFR) out to a redshift around unity is well
established. Beyond z~1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is
flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover.
Some recent analyses of z~6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a
decline from z=3 to z~6, but there is still very little constraint on
the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a
decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as
high as z~6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy
evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is
presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found
to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the
entire range 0&lt;z&lt;~6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution
of the luminosity function (LF) for star-forming galaxies. The LF
evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using
optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 GHz, and a
well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution [L~(1+z)<SUP>Q</SUP>]
and density evolution [phi~(1+z)<SUP>P</SUP>] is found. Combining the
constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the
1.4 GHz radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this
degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be
established. The preferred evolution in a
H<SUB>0</SUB>=70,Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.3,Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=0.7
cosmology from these combined constraints is Q=2.70+/-0.60,
P=0.15+/-0.60.

The comoving luminosity density of the universe, L ( lambda ), is
estimated from the Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) faint galaxy
sample in three wave bands (2800 A, 4400 A, and 1 mu m) over the
redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1. In all three wave bands, L increases
markedly with redshift. For a (q0 = 0.5, Omega = 1.0) cosmological
model, the comoving luminosity density increases as (1 + z)2.1 +/- 0.5
at 1 mu m, as (1 + z)2.7 +/- 0.5 at 4400 A, and as (1 + z)3.9 +/- 0.75
at 2800 A, these exponents being reduced by 0.43 and 1.12 for (0.05,
0.1) and (-0.85, 0.1) cosmological models, respectively. The L ( lambda
)- tau relation can be reasonably well modeled by an actively evolving
stellar population with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) extending
to 125 Mo, and a star formation rate declining as tau -2.5 with a
turn-on of star formation at early epochs. A Scalo IMF extending to the
same mass limit produces too many long-lived low-mass stars. This rapid
evolution of the star formation rate and comoving luminosity density of
the universe is in good agreement with the conclusions of Pei &#38; Fall
from their analysis of the evolving metallicity of the universe. One
consequence of this evolution is that the physical luminosity density at
short wavelengths has probably declined by 2 orders of magnitude since z
~ 1.

Context: Star formation remains an unsolved problem in astrophysics.
Numerical studies of large-scale structure simulations cannot resolve
the process and their approach usually assumes that only gas denser than
a typical threshold can host and form stars.  Aims: We investigate the
onset of cosmological star formation and compare several
very-high-resolution, three-dimensional, N-body/SPH simulations that
include non-equilibrium, atomic and molecular chemistry, star formation
prescriptions, and feedback effects.  Methods: We study how primordial
star formation depends on gas density threshold, cosmological
parameters, and initial set-ups.  Results: For mean-density initial
conditions, we find that standard low-density star-formation threshold
(0.2 h<SUP>2</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) models predict the onset of star
formation at z ~ 25-31, depending on the adopted cosmology. In these
models, stars are formed automatically when the gas density increases
above the adopted threshold, regardless of the time between the moment
when the threshold is reached and the effective runaway collapse. While
this is a reasonable approximation at low redshift, at high redshift
this time interval represents a significant fraction of the Hubble time
and thus this assumption can induce large artificial offsets to the
onset of star formation. Choosing higher density thresholds (135
h<SUP>2</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) allows the entire cooling process to be
followed, and the onset of star formation is then estimated to be at
redshift z ~ 12-16. When isolated, rare, high-density peaks are
considered, the chemical evolution is much faster and the first star
formation episodes occur at z &gsim; 40, almost regardless of the choice
of the density threshold.  Conclusions: These results could have
implications for the formation redshift of the first cosmological
objects, as inferred from direct numerical simulations of mean-density
environments and studies of the reionization history of the universe.

We report Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and new deep optical
spectroscopic observations of PN G135.9+55.9, the most oxygen-poor
planetary nebula located in the Galactic halo. These observations allow
us to estimate the gravity of the central star by fitting the profile of
the observed H I absorption lines with non-LTE model atmospheres. Our
best-fit implies that the central star is still in a pre-white dwarf
stage. We also find large variability of the radial velocities of the
absorption component of the Balmer lines on a timescale of hours. This
is direct evidence that the nucleus of PN G135.9+55.9 is a close binary.
The large semiamplitude of the radial velocity variations and the
probably short period suggest a massive compact companion, likely a
white dwarf. Although our orbital solutions are very preliminary, they
indicate that the total mass of the system probably exceeds the
Chandrasekhar limit. If confirmed, this would make this binary the
potential progenitor of a Type Ia supernova.<p/>

We use the VESPA algorithm and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
to investigate the star formation history of the host galaxies of 257
type Ia supernovae. We find 5sigma evidence of a short-lived
population of progenitors with lifetimes of less than 180 Myr,
indicating a type Ia supernova channel arising from stars in the mass
range ~3.5-8 M_o. As standardizeable candles, type Ia supernovae
play an important role in determining the expansion history of the
Universe, but to be useful for future cosmological surveys, the peak
luminosity needs to be free of uncorrected systematic effects at the
level of 1-2%. If the different progenitor routes lead to supernovae
with even moderately small differences in properties, then these need to
be corrected for separately, or they could lead to a systematic bias in
future supernovae surveys, as the prompt route is likely to increase in
importance at high redshift. VESPA analysis of hosts could be a valuable
tool in this, by identifying which progenitor route is most likely.

We review the current state of the art in double degenerate merger
simulations to better understand the role this phenomenon plays in type
Ia progenitors. Because the fate of a merged system may well depend on
the exact evolution of the matter temperature (as well as mixing of the
merged system), precision simulations are required to determine the true
fate of these systems. Unfortunately, if we compare the results of
current simulations, we find many-order of magnitude differences in
quantities like mass-transfer rates in the merger process. We discuss
these differences and outline an approach using verification and
validation that should allow us to achieve a level of precision
sufficient to determine the true fate (thermonuclear vs. collapse) of
double degenerate mergers. Understanding the fate of lower-mass systems
(e.g. R Coronae Borealis stars) may be key in our final testing phase.

The authors investigate the evolution of a merging pair of C+O white
dwarfs which constitutes a close binary system. The merging process is
simulated as a rapid mass transfer from a less massive white dwarf to a
more massive one at a rate of
1&#215;10<SUP>-5</SUP>M_sun;yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Such a rapid accretion
ignites an off-center carbon flash. The authors found that the carbon
burning front propagates inward all the way through the central region
and hence the CO white dwarf is completely changed into an ONeMg white
dwarf in a quiescent manner. Therefore, the ultimate outcome of the
system will not be a type I supernova explosion induced by the carbon
deflagration but a collapse triggered by electron captures on
<SUP>24</SUP>Mg and <SUP>20</SUP>Ne to form a single neutron star. This
class of neutron star might be an origin of a single millisecond pulsar.

@article{Nomoto:1985,
	Abstract = {
Recent studies have suggested that the merging of two degenerate dwarfs
composed of carbon and oxygen and of total mass larger than the
Chandrasekhar limit occurs at a frequency comparable to that of Type I
supernovae. The rate at which mass is transferred in the merging process
is at present unknown, except that it must be less than some appropriate
Eddington limit. It is found that, unless mass transfer occurs at a rate
less than one-fifth of the Eddington limit for an isolated dwarf, carbon
is ignited off-center, and ignition does not lead immediately to a
deflagration. If carbon continues to burn quiescently until it is
exhausted throughout the star, a neon-oxygen-magnesium white dwarf will
be formed. If a Type I supernova is to follow from merging white dwarfs,
a thick disk must be formed as an intermediate stage in the merging
process, with transfer from the disk onto the central degenerate dwarf
occurring at a rate sufficiently less than Eddington that a deflagration
induced by carbon burning occurs. Thus, the outcome of the merging of
two massive carbon-oxygen degenerate dwarfs is not trivially a Type I
supernova explosion.

@article{Hachisu:2008,
	Abstract = {
We present new evolutionary models for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
progenitors, introducing the mass-stripping effect on a main-sequence
(MS) or slightly evolved companion star by winds from a mass-accreting
white dwarf (WD). The mass stripping attenuates the rate of mass
transfer from the companion to the WD. As a result, a very massive MS
companion can avoid forming a common envelope and thus can increase the
WD mass up until the SN Ia explosion. Including the mass-stripping
effect, we follow binary evolutions of various WD + MS systems and
obtain the parameter region in the initial donor mass-orbital period
plane in which SNe Ia occur. The newly obtained SN Ia region extends to
donor masses of 6-7 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, although its extension depends on
the efficiency of the mass-stripping effect. The stripped matter would
mainly be distributed on the orbital plane and would form very massive
circumstellar matter (CSM) around the SN Ia progenitor. This can explain
the massive CSM around the Type Ia/IIn(IIa) supernovae SN 2002ic and SN
2005gj, as well as the tenuous CSM around the normal Type Ia supernova
SN 2006X. Our new model suggests the presence of very young
(&lt;~10<SUP>8</SUP> yr) populations of SNe Ia, which is consistent with
recent observational indications of young-population SNe Ia.

The time delay between the formation of the progenitor systems of Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their detonation is a vital discriminant
between the various progenitor scenarios that have been proposed for
them. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical and Galaxy Evolution
Explorer (GALEX) ultraviolet observations of the early-type host
galaxies of 21 nearby SNe Ia and quantify the presence or absence of any
young stellar population to constrain the minimum time delay for each
supernova. We find that early-type host galaxies lack `prompt' SNe Ia
with time delays of &lt;~100 Myr and that ~70 per cent SNe Ia have
minimum time delays of 275 Myr-1.25 Gyr, with a median of 650 Myr, while
at least 20 per cent SNe Ia have minimum time delays of at least 1 Gyr
at 95 per cent confidence and two of these four SNe Ia are likely older
than 2 Gyr. The distribution of minimum time delays observed matches
most closely the expectation for the single-degenerate channel with a
main sequence donor. Furthermore, we do not find any evidence that
subluminous SNe Ia are associated with long time delays.

	Abstract = {
The delay time distribution (DTD) of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from
star formation is an important clue to reveal the still unknown
progenitor system of SNe Ia. Here, we report on a measurement of the SN
Ia DTD in a delay time range of t<SUB>Ia</SUB> = 0.1-8.0 Gyr by using
faint variable objects detected in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey
(SXDS) down to i' &tilde; 25.5. We selected 65 SN candidates showing
significant spatial offset from the nuclei of the host galaxies having
an old stellar population at z &tilde; 0.4-1.2, out of more than 1000
SXDS variable objects. Although spectroscopic type classification is not
available for these, we quantitatively demonstrated that more than
&tilde; 80% of these should be SNe Ia. The DTD was derived using stellar
age estimates of the old galaxies based on 9 band photometries from
optical to mid-infrared wavelength. Combined with the observed SN Ia
rate in elliptical galaxies at the local universe, the DTD in
t<SUB>Ia</SUB> &tilde; 0.1-10Gyr is well described by a featureless
power-law as f<SUB>D</SUB>(t<SUB>Ia</SUB>) &prop;
t<SUP>alpha</SUP><SUB>Ia</SUB> with alpha &tilde; -1. The
derived DTD is in excellent agreement with a generic prediction of the
double-degenerate scenario, giving strong support to this scenario. In
the single-degenerate (SD) scenario, although predictions by simple
analytic formulations have broad DTD shapes that are similar to the
observation, DTD shapes calculated by more detailed binary population
synthesis tend to have strong peaks at characteristic time scales, which
do not fit the observation. This result thus indicates either that the
SD channel is not the major contributor to SNe Ia in an old stellar
population, or that an improvement of binary population synthesis theory
is required. Various sources of systematic uncertainties were examined
and tested, but our main conclusions were not affected significantly.

	Abstract = {
A single-degenerate channel for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) is currently accepted, in which a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO
WD) accretes hydrogen-rich material from its companion, increases its
mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and then explodes as a SN Ia.
Incorporating the prescription of Hachisu et al. for the accretion
efficiency into Eggleton's stellar evolution code, and assuming that the
prescription is valid for all metallicities, we performed binary stellar
evolution calculations for more than 25000 close WD binaries with
metallicities Z = 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.004, 0.001,
0.0003 and 0.0001. For our calculations, the companions are assumed to
be unevolved or slightly evolved stars (WD + MS). As a result, the
initial parameter spaces for SNe Ia at various Z are presented in the
orbital period-secondary mass (logP<SUB>i</SUB>,
M<SUP>i</SUP><SUB>2</SUB>) plane. Our study shows that both the initial
mass of the secondary and the initial orbital period increase with
metallicity. Thus, the minimum mass of the CO WD for SNe Ia decreases
with metallicity Z. The difference in the minimum mass may be as large
as 0.24M<SUB>solar</SUB> for different Z.<p/>

Adopting the results above, we studied the birth rate of SNe Ia for
various Z via a binary population synthesis approach. If a single
starburst is assumed, SNe Ia occur systemically earlier and the peak
value of the birth rate is larger for a high Z. The Galactic birth rate
from the WD + MS channel is lower than (but comparable to) that inferred
from observations. Our study indicates that supernovae like SN2002ic
will not occur in extremely low-metallicity environments, if the delayed
dynamical-instability model is appropriate.

	Abstract = {
The single-degenerate model is currently a favorable progenitor model
for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recent investigations on the white
dwarf (WD) + He star channel of the single-degenerate model imply that
this channel is noteworthy for producing SNe Ia. In this paper, we
studied SN&#160;Ia birthrates and delay times of this channel via a
detailed binary population synthesis approach. We found that the
Galactic SN&#160;Ia birthrate from the WD + He star channel is ~0.3
&#215; 10<SUP>--3</SUP> yr<SUP>--1</SUP> according to our
standard model, and that this channel can explain SNe Ia with short
delay times (~4.5 &#215; 10<SUP>7</SUP>-1.4 &#215; 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr).
Meanwhile, these WD + He star systems may be related to the young
supersoft X-ray sources prior to SN&#160;Ia explosions.

We combine the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Extended Source
Catalogue and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to produce an infrared
selected galaxy catalogue with 17173 measured redshifts. We use this
extensive data set to estimate the galaxy luminosity functions in the J-
and K<SUB>S</SUB>-bands. The luminosity functions are fairly well fitted
by Schechter functions with parameters MJ*-5logh=-22.36+/-0.02,
alpha<SUB>J</SUB>=-0.93+/-0.04,
PhiJ*=0.0104+/-0.0016h<SUP>3</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> in the J-band and
MK<SUB>S</SUB>*-5logh=-23.44+/-0.03,
alpha<SUB>K<SUB>S</SUB></SUB>=-0.96+/-0.05,
PhiK<SUB>S</SUB>*=0.0108+/-0.0016h<SUP>3</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> in the
K<SUB>S</SUB>-band (2MASS Kron magnitudes). These parameters are derived
assuming a cosmological model with Omega<SUB>0</SUB>=0.3 and
Lambda<SUB>0</SUB>=0.7. With data sets of this size, systematic rather
than random errors are the dominant source of uncertainty in the
determination of the luminosity function. We carry out a careful
investigation of possible systematic effects in our data. The surface
brightness distribution of the sample shows no evidence that significant
numbers of low surface brightness or compact galaxies are missed by the
survey. We estimate the present-day distributions of
b<SUB>J</SUB>-K<SUB>S</SUB> and J-K<SUB>S</SUB> colours as a function of
the absolute magnitude and use models of the galaxy stellar populations,
constrained by the observed optical and infrared colours, to infer the
galaxy stellar mass function. Integrated over all galaxy masses, this
yields a total mass fraction in stars (in units of the critical mass
density) of Omega<SUB>stars</SUB>h=(1.6+/-0.24)&#215;10<SUP>-3</SUP>
for a Kennicutt initial mass function (IMF) and
Omega<SUB>stars</SUB>h=(2.9+/-0.43)&#215;10<SUP>-3</SUP> for a
Salpeter IMF. These values are consistent with those inferred from
observational estimates of the total star formation history of the
Universe provided that dust extinction corrections are modest.

	Abstract = {
Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have
recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared
measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the
past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH
out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z&lt;~1. We
fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative
uncertainties. Since the z&lt;~1 SFH data are quite precise, we
investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together
affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this
redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we
consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and
supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization
is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper
limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit
on the electron antineutrino (nu<SUB>e</SUB>) flux from past
core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z&lt;~1. We find
consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from
supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed
initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional
Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a
poor representation at low stellar masses (&lt;~1 M<SUB>solar</SUB>),
and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In
particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred,
although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding
issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density
evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and
type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from
core-collapse supernovae.

Aims. This paper aims at providing new conservative constraints on the
cosmic star-formation (SF) history from the empirical modeling of recent
observations in the mid and far infrared.   Methods: We present a new
empirical method based on a non-parametric inversion technique. It
primarily uses multi-wavelength galaxy counts in the infrared and sub-mm
(15, 24, 70, 160, 850 mum), and it does not require any redshift
information. This inversion can be considered as a ``blind''
search for all possible evolutions and shapes of the infrared luminosity
function of galaxies, from which the evolution of the star-formation
rate density (SFRD) and its uncertainties are derived. The cosmic
infrared background (CIRB) measurements are used a posteriori to tighten
the range of solutions. The inversion relies only on two hypotheses: (1)
the luminosity function remains smooth both in redshift and luminosity;
(2) a set of infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies
must be assumed, with a dependency on the total luminosity alone. 
Results: The range of SF histories recovered at low redshift is
well-constrained and consistent with direct measurements from various
redshift surveys. Redshift distributions are recovered without any input
into the redshifts of the sources making the counts. A peak of the SFRD
at z~= 2 is preferred, although higher redshifts are not excluded.
We also demonstrate that galaxy counts at 160 mum present an excess
around 20 mJy that is not consistent with counts at other wavelengths
under the hypotheses cited above. Finally, we find good consistency
between the observed evolution of the stellar mass density and the
prediction from our model of SF history.  Conclusions: Multi-wavelength
counts and CIRB (both projected observations) alone, interpreted with a
luminosity-dependent library of SEDs, contain enough information to
recover the cosmic evolution of the infrared luminosity function of
galaxies, and therefore the evolution of the SFRD, with quantifiable
errors. Moreover, the inability of the inversion to model perfectly and
simultaneously the multi-wavelength infrared counts implies either (i)
the existence of a sub-population of colder galaxies; (ii) a larger
dispersion of dust temperatures among local galaxies than expected;
(iii) a redshift evolution of the infrared SED of galaxies.<p/>

	Abstract = {
We develop a method for interpreting faint galaxy data which focuses on
the integrated light radiated from the galaxy population as a whole. The
emission history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and
near-infrared wavelengths is modeled from the present epoch to z ~ 4 by
tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density,
as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble
Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. In a q0 = 0.5, h50 = 1 cosmology, the
global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well
fitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent
star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal
initial mass function (IMF) extending from 0.1 to 125 Mo. While a
Salpeter IMF with a modest amount of dust reddening or a somewhat
steeper mass function, phi (m) ~ m-2.7, can both reproduce the data
reasonably well, a Scalo IMF produces too much long-wavelength light and
is unable to match the observed mean galaxy colors. In the best-fit
models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude,
from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z ~ 1.5 in the range
0.12-0.17 Mo yr-1 Mpc-3, to fall again at higher redshifts. After
integrating the inferred star formation rate over cosmic time, we find a
stellar mass density at the present epoch of Omega <SUB>s</SUB>
h<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>50</SUB>&gt;~0.005 , hence a mean stellar
mass-to-light ratio &gt;~4 in the B-band and &gt;~1 in K, consistent
with the values observed in nearby galaxies of various morphological
types. The models are able to account for the entire background light
recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels
probed by the HDF. Since only ~20% of the current stellar content of
galaxies is produced at z &gt; 2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is
expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed
enrichment history of the damped Ly alpha systems. The biggest
uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained amount of starlight
that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early epochs. A
"monolithic collapse" model, where half of the present-day stars formed
at z &gt; 2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the
global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high
redshifts as sampled by quasi-stellar object absorbers.

We have measured the rest-frame lambda~1500 &#197; comoving specific
luminosity density of star-forming galaxies at redshift 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.5
(Lyman break galaxies [LBGs]) selected from deep, multiband images taken
with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys,
obtained as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS).
The samples cover ~0.09 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and are also relatively deep,
reaching between 0.2L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>3</SUB> and
0.5L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>3</SUB>, depending on the redshift, where
L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>3</SUB> is the characteristic UV luminosity of LBGs at
z~3. The specific luminosity density appears to be nearly constant with
redshift over the range 3&lt;z&lt;6, although the measure at z~6 remains
relatively uncertain, because it depends on the accurate estimate of the
faint counts of the z~6 sample. If LBGs are fair tracers of the cosmic
star formation activity, our results suggest that at z~6, namely, at
less than ~7% of the current cosmic age, the universe was already
producing stars as vigorously as it did near its maximum several
gigayears later, at 1&lt;~z&lt;~3.<p/>

We re-assess the question of a systematic time delay between the
formation of the progenitor and its explosion in a Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) using the Hubble Higher-z Supernova Search sample. While a previous
analysis indicated a significant time delay, with a most likely value of
3.4 Gyr, effectively ruling out all previously proposed progenitor
models, our analysis shows that the time-delay estimate is dominated by
systematic errors, in particular due to uncertainties in the star
formation history (SFH). We find that none of the popular progenitor
models under consideration can be ruled out with any significant degree
of confidence. The inferred time delay is mainly determined by the peak
in the assumed SFH. We show that, even with a much larger supernova
sample, the time-delay distribution cannot be reliably reconstructed
without better constraints on the SFH.

We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the properties of
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves in the near-infrared using recent
data from Peters Automated InfraRed Imaging TELescope and the
literature. We construct a hierarchical Bayesian framework,
incorporating several uncertainties including photometric error,
peculiar velocities, dust extinction, and intrinsic variations, for
principled and coherent statistical inference. SN Ia light-curve
inferences are drawn from the global posterior probability of parameters
describing both individual supernovae and the population conditioned on
the entire SN Ia NIR data set. The logical structure of the hierarchical
model is represented by a directed acyclic graph. Fully Bayesian
analysis of the model and data is enabled by an efficient Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm exploiting the conditional probabilistic structure
using Gibbs sampling. We apply this framework to the JHK<SUB>s</SUB> SN
Ia light-curve data. A new light-curve model captures the observed
J-band light-curve shape variations. The marginal intrinsic variances in
peak absolute magnitudes are sigma(M<SUB>J</SUB> ) = 0.17 &#177;
0.03, sigma(M<SUB>H</SUB> ) = 0.11 &#177; 0.03, and
sigma(M<SUB>Ks</SUB> ) = 0.19 &#177; 0.04. We describe the first
quantitative evidence for correlations between the NIR absolute
magnitudes and J-band light-curve shapes, and demonstrate their utility
for distance estimation. The average residual in the Hubble diagram for
the training set SNe at cz &gt; 2000kms<SUP>--1</SUP> is 0.10 mag.
The new application of bootstrap cross-validation to SN Ia light-curve
inference tests the sensitivity of the statistical model fit to the
finite sample and estimates the prediction error at 0.15 mag. These
results demonstrate that SN Ia NIR light curves are as effective as
corrected optical light curves, and, because they are less vulnerable to
dust absorption, they have great potential as precise and accurate
cosmological distance indicators.

@article{Cooper:2009,
	Abstract = {
Using data drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SDSS-II
Supernova Survey, we study the local environments of confirmed type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) in the nearby universe. At 0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, we
find that SN Ia events in blue, star-forming galaxies occur
preferentially in regions of lower galaxy density relative to galaxies
of like stellar mass and star-formation rate, while SNe Ia in nearby red
galaxies show no significant environment dependence within the
measurement uncertainties. Even though our samples of SNe in red hosts
are relatively small in number, tests on simulated galaxy samples
suggest that the observed distribution of environments for red SN Ia
hosts is in poor agreement with a cluster type Ia rate strongly elevated
relative to the field rate. Finally, after considering the impact of
galaxy morphology, stellar age, stellar metallicity, and other relevant
galaxy properties, we conclude that the observed correlation between the
SN Ia rate and environment in the star-forming galaxy population is
likely driven by a gas-phase metallicity effect, such that prompt type
Ia supernovae occur more often or are more luminous in metal-poor
systems.

The purpose of this work is the computation of the cosmic Type Ia
supernova rates, namely the frequency of Type Ia supernovae per unit
time in a unitary volume of the Universe. Our main goal in this work is
to predict the Type Ia supernova rates at very high redshifts and to
check whether it is possible to select the best delay time distribution
model, on the basis of the available observations of Type Ia supernovae.
We compute the cosmic Type Ia supernova rates in different scenarios for
galaxy formation and predict the expected number of explosions at high
redshift (z=>2). Moreover, we adopt various progenitor models in
order to compute the Type Ia supernova rate in typical elliptical
galaxies of initial luminous masses of
10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>o</SUB>,10<SUP>11</SUP>M<SUB>o</SUB> and
10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>o</SUB>, and compute the total amount of iron
produced by Type Ia supernovae in each case. In this analysis we assume
that Type Ia supernovae are caused by thermonuclear explosions of
C--O white dwarfs in binary systems and we consider the most
popular frameworks: the single degenerate and the double degenerate
scenarios. The two competing schemes for the galaxy formation, namely
the monolithic collapse and the hierarchical clustering, are also taken
into account, by considering the histories of star formation increasing
and decreasing with redshift, respectively. We calculate the Type Ia
supernova rates through an analytical formulation which rests upon the
definition of the SN Ia rate following an instantaneous burst of star
formation as a function of the time elapsed from the birth of the
progenitor system to its explosion as a Type Ia supernova (i.e. the
delay time). What emerges from this work is that: (i) we confirm the
result of previous papers that it is not easy to select the best delay
time distribution scenario from the observational data and this is
because the cosmic star formation rate dominates over the distribution
function of the delay times; (ii) the monolithic collapse scenario for
galaxy formation predicts an increasing trend of the SN Ia rate at high
redshifts (mainly due to the contribution by massive spheroids), whereas
the predicted rate in the framework of a decreasing cosmic star
formation rate, more in agreement with the hierarchical scenario, drops
dramatically at high redshift; (iii) for the elliptical galaxies we note
that the predicted maximum of the Type Ia supernova rate depends on the
initial galactic mass. The maximum occurs earlier (at about 0.3 Gyr) in
the most massive ellipticals, as a consequence of the assumed downsizing
in star formation. In addition, we find that the Type Ia supernova rate
per unit mass at the present time is higher in bluer ellipticals (i.e.
the less massive ones).

We present a new survey strategy to discover and study high-redshift
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By
targeting massive galaxy clusters at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, we obtain a
twofold improvement in the efficiency of finding SNe compared to an HST
field survey and a factor of 3 improvement in the total yield of SN
detections in relatively dust-free red-sequence galaxies. In total,
sixteen SNe were discovered at z&gt;0.95, nine of which were in galaxy
clusters. This strategy provides an SN sample that can be used to
decouple the effects of host-galaxy extinction and intrinsic color in
high-redshift SNe, thereby reducing one of the largest systematic
uncertainties in SN cosmology.<p/>

@article{Connolly:2009,
	Abstract = {
Upcoming large-scale ground- and space- based supernova surveys will
face a challenge identifying supernova candidates largely without the
use of spectroscopy. Over the past several years, a number of supernova
identification schemes have been proposed that rely on photometric
information only. Some of these schemes use color-color or
color-magnitude diagrams; others simply fit supernova data to models.
Both of these approaches suffer a number of drawbacks partially
addressed in the so-called Bayesian-based supernova classification
techniques. However, Bayesian techniques are also problematic in that
they typically require that the supernova candidate be one of a known
set of supernova types. This presents a number of problems, the most
obvious of which is that there are bound to be objects that do not
conform to any presently known model in large supernova candidate
samples. We propose a new photometric classification scheme that uses a
Bayes factor based on color in order to identify supernovae by type.
This method does not require knowledge of the complete set of possible
astronomical objects that could mimic a supernova signal. Further, as a
Bayesian approach, it accounts for all systematic and statistical
uncertainties of the measurements in a single step. To illustrate the
use of the technique, we apply it to a simulated dataset for a possible
future large-scale space-based Joint Dark Energy Mission and demonstrate
how it could be used to identify Type Ia supernovae. The method's
utility in pre-selecting and ranking supernova candidates for possible
spectroscopic follow-up -- i.e., its usage as a supernova trigger --
will be briefly discussed.

We report the imaging and spectroscopic localization of GRB 060218 to a
low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxy at z=0.03345+/-0.00006. In
addition to making it the second nearest gamma-ray burst known, optical
spectroscopy reveals the earliest detection of weak, supernova-like Si
II near 5720 &#197; (~0.1c), starting 1.95 days after the burst
trigger. UBVRI photometry obtained between 1 and 26 days postburst
confirms the early rise of supernova light, and suggests a short time
delay between the gamma-ray burst and the onset of SN 2006aj if the
early appearance of a soft component in the X-ray spectrum is understood
as a ``shock breakout.'' Together, these results verify the
long-hypothesized origin of soft gamma-ray bursts in the deaths of
massive stars.

Observations and modeling for the light curve (LC) and spectra of
supernova (SN) 2005bf are reported. This SN showed unique features: the
LC had two maxima, and declined rapidly after the second maximum, while
the spectra showed strengthening He lines whose velocity increased with
time. The double-peaked LC can be reproduced by a double-peaked
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution, with most <SUP>56</SUP>Ni at low velocity
and a small amount at high velocity. The rapid postmaximum decline
requires a large fraction of the gamma-rays to escape from the
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni-dominated region, possibly because of low-density
``holes.'' The presence of Balmer lines in the spectrum suggests that
the He layer of the progenitor was substantially intact. Increasing
gamma-ray deposition in the He layer due to enhanced gamma-ray
escape from the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-dominated region may explain both the
delayed strengthening and the increasing velocity of the He lines. The
SN has massive ejecta (~6-7 M<SUB>solar</SUB>), normal kinetic energy
[~(1.0-1.5) &#215; 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs], a high peak bolometric
luminosity (~5&#215;10<SUP>42</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>) for an epoch
as late as ~ 40 days, and a large <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass (~0.32
M<SUB>solar</SUB>). These properties and the presence of a small amount
of H suggest that the progenitor was initially massive (M~25-30
M<SUB>solar</SUB>) and had lost most of its H envelope, and was possibly
a WN star. The double-peaked <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution suggests that
the explosion may have formed jets that did not reach the He layer. The
properties of SN 2005bf resemble those of the explosion of Cassiopeia A.

We present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through
near-infrared) and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on
supernova (SN) 2008D as well as X-ray data analysis on the associated
Swift X-ray transient (XRT) 080109. Our data span a time range of 5 hr
before the detection of the X-ray transient to 150&#160;days after its
detection, and a detailed analysis allowed us to derive constraints on
the nature of the SN and its progenitor; throughout we draw comparisons
with results presented in the literature and find several key aspects
that differ. We show that the X-ray spectrum of XRT 080109 can be fit
equally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal
parts of both power law and blackbody. Our data first established that
SN 2008D is a spectroscopically normal SN Ib (i.e., showing conspicuous
He lines) and showed that SN 2008D had a relatively long rise time of
18&#160;days and a modest optical peak luminosity. The early-time light
curves of the SN are dominated by a cooling stellar envelope (for
Deltat&ap;0.1-4&#160;days, most pronounced in the blue bands) followed
by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay. We construct a reliable measurement of the
bolometric output for this stripped-envelope SN, and, combined with
estimates of E <SUB>K</SUB> and M <SUB>ej</SUB> from the literature,
estimate the stellar radius R <SUB>sstarf</SUB> of its probable
Wolf-Rayet progenitor. According to the model of Waxman et&#160;al. and
Chevalier &#38; Fransson, we derive R <SUP>W07</SUP> <SUB>sstarf</SUB> =
1.2 &#177; 0.7R <SUB>sun</SUB> and R <SUP>CF08</SUP> <SUB>sstarf</SUB>
= 12 &#177; 7 R <SUB>sun</SUB>, respectively; the latter being more in
line with typical WN stars. Spectra obtained at three and four months
after maximum light show double-peaked oxygen lines that we associate
with departures from spherical symmetry, as has been suggested for the
inner ejecta of a number of SN Ib cores.

We present early photometric and spectroscopic data on the afterglow of
GRB 060218 and report the evolution of the underlying supernova SN
2006aj. Our data span a time range of 4-23 days after the GRB and
clearly establish that SN 2006aj is a fast-evolving broad-lined Type Ic
SN with an extremely short rise time (~10 days) and a large optical peak
luminosity (M<SUB>V</SUB>=-18.7 mag). The supernova properties are
deduced well since the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow does not
contribute a significant amount to the total light output. The spectra
show broad lines indicative of large expansion velocities but are better
matched by those of SN 2002ap and SN 1997ef (not associated with a GRB)
than those of the prototypical GRB-related SN 1998bw. We refine the
redshift estimate to z=0.03351+/-0.00007. The host galaxy is a
low-metallicity dwarf galaxy (with M<SUB>V,host</SUB>=-16.0 mag),
similar to host galaxies of other GRB-associated SNe.<p/>

Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint
facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.

We present a selection of very well time-sampled, high-quality and
homogeneous optical and NIR light curves and optical spectra of 20
nearby (z &lt; 0.03) SN Ib/c from the CfA database, taken with the FLWO,
Magellan and Gemini Telescopes. The data begin as early as two weeks
before maximum light and go to late times, when the supernovae enter the
nebular phase. We discuss general properties of this population of
core-collapse supernovae, including their luminosity distribution.
Specifically, we present data of SN 2005bf, a unique Type Ib SN, and of
SN 2006aj, the most recent spectroscopically-confirmed SN associated
with GRB060218, including the only available NIR (JHKs) light curves of
this GRB-SN.

We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN 1992ar, the
most distant supernova (SN) in the Cal&#225;n/Tololo Survey. We
compare its spectrum with those of nearby Type Ia and Ic SNe and
conclude that the latter type is a better match to SN 1992ar. Using
K-corrections based on the spectra of well-observed Type Ic and Ia SNe,
we compute different possible rest-frame light curves of SN 1992ar and
compare them with those of representative SNe of each type observed in
the nearby universe. From the photometry and the spectra, we are able to
conclude that SN 1992ar cannot be matched by any known example of a Type
Ia SN. Even though the data set collected is fairly complete (one
spectrum and 10 photometric points), it is not possible to decide
whether SN 1992ar was a fast Type Ic SN, like SN 1994I, or a slow one,
like SN 1983V. The absolute V magnitudes at maximum implied by each of
these possibilities are -19.2 and -20.2, respectively. The latter would
make SN 1992ar one of the brightest SNe on record. SN 1992ar, hence,
illustrates the problem of contamination faced by the high-z Type Ia SNe
samples whose luminosity distances are used to determine the
cosmological parameters of the universe. We present observational
criteria to distinguish the two SN types when the Si II 6355 &#197;
line is redshifted out of the sensitivity range of typical CCD detectors
and discuss the effect that these luminous Type Ic SNe would have on the
measured cosmological parameters, if not removed from the high-z Type Ia
SN samples.

We combine the CfA3 supernovae Type Ia (SN&#160;Ia) sample with samples
from the literature to calculate improved constraints on the dark energy
equation of state parameter, w. The CfA3 sample is added to the Union
set of Kowalski et al. to form the Constitution set and, combined with a
BAO prior, produces 1 + w = 0.013<SUP>+0.066</SUP>
<SUB>--0.068</SUB> (0.11 syst), consistent with the cosmological
constant. The CfA3 addition makes the cosmologically useful sample of
nearby SN&#160;Ia between 2.6 and 2.9 times larger than before, reducing
the statistical uncertainty to the point where systematics play the
largest role. We use four light-curve fitters to test for systematic
differences: SALT, SALT2, MLCS2k2 (R<SUB>V</SUB> = 3.1), and MLCS2k2
(R<SUB>V</SUB> = 1.7). SALT produces high-redshift Hubble residuals with
systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than MLCS2k2. MLCS2k2
overestimates the intrinsic luminosity of SN&#160;Ia with 0.7 &lt;
Delta &lt; 1.2. MLCS2k2 with R<SUB>V</SUB> = 3.1 overestimates
host-galaxy extinction while R<SUB>V</SUB> &ap; 1.7 does not. Our
investigation is consistent with no Hubble bubble. We also find that,
after light-curve correction, SN&#160;Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts are
intrinsically fainter than those in E/S0 hosts by 2sigma, suggesting
that they may come from different populations. We also find that
SN&#160;Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts have low scatter (0.1 mag) and reddening.
Current systematic errors can be reduced by improving SN&#160;Ia
photometric accuracy, by including the CfA3 sample to retrain
light-curve fitters, by combining optical SN&#160;Ia photometry with
near-infrared photometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by
determining if different environments give rise to different intrinsic
SN&#160;Ia luminosity after correction for light-curve shape and color.

We present multiband photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), with
over 11,500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at
the F. L. Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics (CfA). This sample contains the largest number of
homogeneously observed and reduced nearby SNe Ia (z lsim 0.08) published
to date. It more than doubles the nearby sample, bringing SN Ia
cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties dominate. Our
natural system photometry has a precision of lsim0.02 mag in BVRIr'i'
and lsim0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We also
estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard
system BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our
standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and
comparison stars, where available for the same SN, reveal agreement at
the level of a few hundredths mag in most cases. We find that
1991bg-like SNe Ia are sufficiently distinct from other SNe Ia in their
color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that they should be
treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training samples. The
CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better
light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where
near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help
disentangle host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color,
reducing the systematic uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.

We show that the spectrum of the unusual transient SCP&#160;06F6 is
consistent with emission from a cool, optically thick and carbon-rich
atmosphere if the transient is located at a redshift of z &ap; 0.14. The
implied extragalactic nature of the transient rules out novae, shell
flashes, and V838&#160;Mon-like events as causes of the observed
brightening. The distance to SCP&#160;06F6 implies a peak magnitude of
M<SUB>I</SUB> sime --18, in the regime of supernovae (SNe). While
the morphology of the light curve of SCP&#160;06F6 around the peak in
brightness resembles the slowly evolving Type IIn supernovae
SN&#160;1994Y and SN&#160;2006gy its spectroscopic appearance differs
from all previous observed SNe. We further report the detection of an
X-ray source coincident with SCP&#160;06F6 in a target of opportunity
XMM-Newton observation made during the declining phase of the transient.
The X-ray luminosity of L <SUB>X</SUB> sime (5 &#177; 1) &#215;
10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> is 2 orders of magnitude higher than
observed to date from SNe. If related to an SN event, SCP&#160;06F6 may
define a new class. An alternative, though less likely, scenario is the
tidal disruption of a carbon-rich star.

Optical and near-infrared (near-IR) observations of the Type Ic
supernova (SN Ic) 2004aw are presented, obtained from -3 to +413 d with
respect to the B-band maximum. The photometric evolution is
characterized by a comparatively slow post-maximum decline of the light
curves. The peaks in redder bands are significantly delayed relative to
the bluer bands, the I-band maximum occurring 8.4 d later than that in
B. With an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in the V band the SN can be
considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. This also holds for the U
through I bolometric light curve, where SN 2004aw has a position
intermediate between SNe 2002ap and 1998bw. Spectroscopically SN 2004aw
provides a link between a normal SN Ic like SN 1994I and the group of
broad-lined SNe Ic. The spectral evolution is rather slow, with a
spectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. The shape of
the nebular [OI] lambdalambda6300, 6364 line indicates a highly
aspherical explosion. Helium cannot be unambiguously identified in the
spectra, even in the near-IR. Using an analytical description of the
light-curve peak we find that the total mass of the ejecta in SN 2004aw
is 3.5-8.0M<SUB>solar</SUB>, significantly larger than that in SN 1994I,
although not as large as in SN 1998bw. The same model suggests that
about 0.3M<SUB>solar</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni has been synthesized in
the explosion. No connection to a GRB can be firmly established.<p/>

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a key role in recent advances in our
understanding of the Universe. We present cosmological applications of
SNe Ia, including observational results as part of an ongoing campaign
at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to monitor newly
discovered SNe Ia at the F. L. Whipple Observatory (FLWO). We describe
observations and analysis of SN 1998bu in M96, the only SN Ia yet to
have appeared in a galaxy with a previously measured Hubble Space
Telescope Cepheid distance. We show that SN 1998bu was a normal,
reddened SN Ia and use it to constrain the Hubble constant, with
attention to systematic uncertainties. We also present the largest set
of SN Ia photometry published to date, consisting of 2190  UBVRI FLWO
CCD observations of 44 SNe Ia discovered between 1997 and 2000. The
large, homogeneous sample of U-band light curves is unique, with
important applications to SN Ia at high redshift, and we present the
first detailed description of SN Ia U-band properties. We also develop
MLCS2k2, a new incarnation of the Multicolor Light Curve Shape method to
measure SN Ia distances, incorporating the U-band and other
improvements. Application of MLCS2k2 to a large sample of Hubble-flow
and Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia yields an estimate of H<SUB> 0</SUB> = 66
&#177; 3 (random) &#177; 7 (systematic) or 76 &#177; 3 &#177; 8
km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, depending on which of
two discrepant sets of Cepheid distances is used. With the High-Z SN
Search Team, we present cosmological constraints on the dark energy
equation of state, and combined constraints on Omega<SUB>M</SUB> and
Omega<SUB>A</SUB> from SNe Ia and the cosmic microwave background.
Finally, via observations at FLWO, we measure the redshift of an
extremely distant exploding star, GRB 010222, at z = 1.477.

We present BVRI photometry of the Type Ia supernovae 1999da, 1999dk,
1999gp, 2000bk, and 2000ce, plus infrared photometry of three of these.
These objects exhibit the full range of decline rates of Type Ia
supernovae. Combined optical and infrared data show that families of
V-infrared color curves can be used to derive the host extinction
(A<SUB>V</SUB>) of these objects. Existing data do not yet allow us to
construct these loci for all color indices and supernova decline rates,
but the V-K color evolution is sufficiently uniform that it allows the
determination of host extinction over a wide range of supernova decline
rates to an accuracy of roughly +/-0.1 mag. We introduce a new empirical
parameter, the mean I-band flux 20 to 40 days after maximum light, and
show how it is directly related to the decline rate.

VRI photometry of the type Ia supernova 2002bo is presented.  This SN
exploded in a dusty region of the host galaxy NGC 3190, thus,
subtraction of a template frame was necessary to obtain reliable
photometry. We used a template frame of NGC 3190 taken during the course
of our galaxy imaging project, fortunately, just a few days before SN
2002bo was discovered. The aim of this project is to collect template
frames of nearby galaxies that are potential hosts of bright SNe.
Subtraction of pre-SN images helped us to exclude the background light
contamination of the host galaxy. The maximum occurred at JD 2,452,346,
with maximal V bright ness of 13.58m.  MLCS analysis led to
T<SUB>0</SUB>(B) = JD 2,452,346.1 &#177; 0.8 (fiducial B-maximum),
E(B-V),= 0.24m &#177; 0.02m, mu<SUB>0</SUB>=32.46&#177;0.06$,
Delta=-0.14&#177;0.04. E(B-V)=0.24m(2) indicates a significant
extinction in the host galaxy as the galactic reddening is negligible
toward NGC 3190. The accepted value of Delta indicates that SN 2002bo
was a slightly overluminous SN by about 0.14m relative to fiducial SN
type Ia.  The distance turned out to be 31.0&#177;3 Mpc. In addition,
the heavily obscured SN 2002cv was also detected on the I frame taken on
JD 2,452,434 (June 8, 2002), and a variable star is found in the field,
very close to the host galaxy.

d after. The pre-maximum optical coverage is particularly complete. The
extinction deduced from the observed colour evolution and from
interstellar Na I D absorption is quite high, namely E(B-V) = 0.43 +/-
0.10. On the other hand, model matches to the observed spectra point to
a lower reddening [E(B-V) ~ 0.30]. In some respects, SN 2002bo behaves
as a typical `Branch normal' type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at optical and
infrared wavelengths. We find a B-band risetime of 17.9 +/- 0.5 d, a
Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) of 1.13 +/- 0.05, and a dereddened
M<SUB>B</SUB>=-19.41 +/- 0.42. However, comparison with other type Ia
supernovae having similar Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) values indicates that
in other respects SN 2002bo is unusual. While the optical spectra of SN
2002bo are very similar to those of SN 1984A [Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) =
1.19], lower velocities and a generally more structured appearance are
found in SNe 1990N, 1994D and 1998bu. For supernovae having
Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) &gt; 1.2, we confirm the variation of with
Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B). However, for supernovae such as SN 2002bo,
with lower values of Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) the relation breaks down.
Moreover, the evolution of for SN 2002bo is strikingly different from
that shown by other type Ia supernovae. The velocities of SN 2002bo and
1984A derived from S II 5640 &#197;, Si II 6355 &#197; and Ca II H and
K lines are either much higher and/or evolve differently from those seen
in other normal SNe Ia events. Thus, while SN 2002bo and SN 1984A appear
to be highly similar, they exhibit behaviour which is distinctly
different from other SNe Ia having similar Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)
values. We suggest that the unusually low temperature, the presence of
high-velocity intermediate-mass elements and the low abundance of carbon
at early times indicates that burning to Si penetrated to much higher
layers than in more normal type Ia supernovae. This may be indicative of
a delayed detonation explosion.

We present late-epoch optical photometry (BVRI) of seven normally

2000cx, SN 2001C, SN 2001V, SN 2001bg, and SN 2001dp. The photometry of
these objects was obtained using a template subtraction method to
eliminate galaxy light contamination during aperture photometry. We show
the optical light curves of these supernovae out to epochs of up to ~640
days after the explosion of the supernova. We show a linear decline in
these data during the epoch of 200-500 days after explosion, with the
decline rate in the B, V, and R bands equal to about 1.4 mag per 100
days, but the decline rate of the I-band is much shallower at 0.94 mag
per 100 days.

CCD photometry is presented of the type Ia SN 2001V occurred in the
edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3987. The observations made through
Johnson-Cousins BVRI filters were collected from Feb. 24 (t = - 8 days,
with respect to B-maximum), up to May 5 (t = +62 days). The light curves
are analyzed with the revised Multi-Colour Light Curve Shape (MLCS)
method (\cite{riess2}) by fitting template vectors to the observed light
curves simultaneously. The reddening of SN 2001V is estimated to be
E(B-V)=0.05 mag, while the galactic component is E(B-V) = 0.02 mag
(Schlegel et al. \cite{sfd}), suggesting that part of the reddening may
be due to the ISM in the host galaxy. The Delta parameter in MLCS
converged to -0.47 mag, indicating that this SN was overluminous
relative to the majority of Type Ia SNe. The inferred distance to its
host galaxy, NGC 3987, is 74.5 +/- 5 Mpc, which is in good agreement
with recently determined kinematic distances, based on radial velocity
corrected for Virgo-infall and Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> = 65 km

A large wide-field telescope and camera with optical throughput over 200
m<SUP>2</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP> -- a factor of 50 beyond what we currently
have -- would enable the detection of faint moving or bursting optical
objects: from Earth threatening asteroids to energetic events at the
edge of the optical universe. An optimized design for LSST is a 8.4 m
telescope with a 3 degree field of view and an optical throughput of 260
m<SUP>2</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP>. With its large throughput and dedicated
all-sky monitoring mode, the LSST will reach 24th magnitude in a single
10 second exposure, opening unexplored regions of astronomical parameter
space. The heart of the 2.3 Gpixel camera will be an array of imager
modules with 10 mum pixels. Once each month LSST will survey up to
14,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the sky with many ~10 second exposures. Over
time LSST will survey 30,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> deeply in multiple
bandpasses, enabling innovative investigations ranging from galactic
structure to cosmology. This is a shift in paradigm for optical
astronomy: from "survey follow-up" to "survey direct science." The
resulting real-time data products and fifteen petabyte time-tagged
imaging database and photometric catalog will provide a unique resource.
A collaboration of ~80 engineers and scientists are gearing up to
confront this exciting challenge.

One of the primary branches of the PS1 science strategy is the Medium
Deep survey, which will detect thousands of supernovae and other
explosive transients. This extraordinary yield from a single survey will
allow us to put new constraints on the nature of Dark Energy and to
improve our understanding of the progenitor systems that produce Type Ia
Supernovae. We present early detections from the Fall 2008 PS1 campaign.

We describe the scientific motivation for achieving photometric
precision and accuracy below the 1% level, and we present a calibration
philosophy based on using calibrated detectors rather than celestial
sources as the fundamental metrology reference. A description of the
apparatus and methodology is presented, as well as preliminary
measurements of relative system throughput versus wavelength for the
Mosaic imager at the CTIO Blanco 4-m telescope. We measure the
throughput of the optics, filter, and detector by comparing the flux
seen by the instrument to that seen by a precisely calibrated monitor
photodiode,  using a tunable laser as the illumination source. This
allows us to measure the transmission properties of the system, passband
by passband, with full pupil illumination of the entire optical train.
These preliminary results are sufficiently promising that we intend to
further pursue this technique, particularly for next-generation survey
projects such as PanSTARRS and LSST.

The W40 complex is a nearby site of recent massive star formation
composed of a dense molecular cloud adjacent to an HII region that
contains an embedded OB star cluster.  The HII region is beginning to
blister out and break free from its envelope of molecular gas, but our
line of sight to the central stars is largely obscured by intervening
dust.  Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible at optical, infrared, or
cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that heats the HII
region. The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a small
number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at
various wavelengths, but the lower mass stellar population remains
largely unexamined. Despite its modest optical appearance, at 600 pc W40
is  one of the nearest massive star forming regions, and with a UV flux
of about 1/10th of the Orion Nebula Cluster, this neglected region
deserves detailed investigation.

Motivated by recent models involving off-centre ignition of Type Ia
supernova explosions, we undertake three-dimensional time-dependent
radiation transport simulations to investigate the range of bolometric
light-curve properties that could be observed from supernovae in which
there is a lop-sided distribution of the products from nuclear burning.
We consider both a grid of artificial toy models which illustrate the
conceivable range of effects and a recent three-dimensional
hydrodynamical explosion model. We find that observationally significant
viewing angle effects are likely to arise in such supernovae and that
these may have important ramifications for the interpretation of the
observed diversity of Type Ia supernova and the systematic uncertainties
which relate to their use as standard candles in contemporary cosmology.

general solution of functional equations on associativity. We define the 
characteristics of those functions f (x) which are necessary for the pro- 
duction of operators. We shall show, that with the help of the negation 
operator for every such function f (x) a function g (x) can be given, from 
which a disjunctive operator can be derived, and for the three operators 
the DeMorgan identity is fulfilled. For the fulfillment of the DeMorgan 
identity the necessary and sufficient conditions are given. 
We shall also show that an fλ (x) can be constructed for every f (x) , so 
that for the derived kλ (x, y) and dλ (x, y) limλ 
−→∞ kλ (x, y) = min (x, y) 
and limλ 
−→∞ dλ (x, y) = max (x, y) . 
As Yager's operator is not reducible, for every λ there exist an α, for 
which, in case x < α and y < α, kλ (x, y) = 0. 
We shall give an f (x) which has the characteristics of Yager's operator, 
and which is strictly monotone. 
Finally we shall show, that with the help of all those f (x), which are 
necessary when constructing a k (x, y) , an F (x) can be constructed which 
has the properties of the measures of fuzziness introduced by A. De Luca 
and S. Termini. Some classical fuzziness measures are obtained as special

Fuzzy measures are actually set functions which are monotonic with respect to set inclusion. Triangular norms and conorms are semi-groups of the unit interval which have been thoroughly studied in the literature of functional equations. The proposed class encompasses probability measures, Zadeh's possibility measures and the dual notion of necessity measures. Any set function of the class can be expressed in terms of a density, and constructively defined out of this density. This feature makes the proposed framework attractive from a practical point of view for the representation and manipulation of subjective evidence. The link between t-norm and t-conorm based set functions and Shafer's belief functions is invesligaled.},

However, it aroused many controversies about its validity, and many alternatives have been proposed. The paper examines the model of combination in Dempster's original paper and indicates that handling of the independence required among multiple pieces of evidence is strange from the viewpoint of semantics, where the independence among occurrences of multiple pieces of information might be confused with the consistency among contents of the information. The paper then proposes a new model of combination and a new rule of combination called combination by compromise as a consensus generator. The properties of the proposed combination as well as several alternative combination methods proposed so far are discussed in the light of the drawbacks and advantages of Dempster rule. Several numerical examples which demonstrate the properties are also shown. The discussion and the examples suggest that the proposed combination produces the most preferable results among them from the viewpoints of consensus generation.},

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

Procedures of statistical inference are described which generalize Bayesian inference in specific ways. Probability is used in such a way that in general only bounds may be placed on the probabilities of given events, and probability systems of this kind are suggested both for sample information and for prior information. These systems are then combined using a specified rule. Illustrations are given for inferences about trinomial probabilities, and for inferences about a monotone sequence of binomial pi. Finally, some comments are made on the general class of models which produce upper and lower probabilities, and on the specific models which underlie the suggested inference procedures.},

	Abstract = {This paper has two major parts. The first is an extensive analysis of the problem of induction, and the second part is a detailed study of selective induction. Throughout the paper we integrate a number of notions, mainly from artificial intelligence, but also from pattern recognition and cognitive psychology. The result is a synthetic view which exploits uncertainty, task-guidance, and biases such as language restriction. Some of the main themes and contributions are as follows. (1) Practical induction is really a problem of efficacy and efficiency (power). (2) Search in a space of hypothetical concepts is governed by acredibility function which combines various knowledge sources in a single subjective probability or belief measure mu. (3) The amount of knowledge supplied by various sources can often be quantified; these sources include various biases and the learning system itself. (4) Induction is equivalent to discovery of autility function u, which captures the purpose or goal of induction. (5) The difficulty of induction may be characterized by the form of u. Smooth or coherent functions mean selective induction, which has had the most attention in machine learning. (6) Systems for selective induction are more similar than commonly understood. By juxtaposing them we can discover similarities and improvements. (7) Our analysis suggests a number of incipient principles for powerful induction.},

	Abstract = {The case-based learning paradigm relies upon 
memorizing cases in the form of successful prob- 
lem solving experience, such as e.g. a pattern along 
with its classification in pattern recognition or a 
problem along with a solution in case-based rea- 
soning. When it comes to solving a new problem, 
each of these cases serves as an individual piece of 
evidence that gives an indication of the solution to 
that problem. In this paper, we elaborate on issues 
concerning the proper combination (aggregation) 
of such pieces of evidence. Particularly, we argue 
that cases retrieved from a case library must not be 
considered as independent information sources, as 
implicitly done by most case-based learning meth- 
ods. Focusing on the problem of prediction as a 
performance task, we propose a new inference prin- 
ciple that combines potentially interacting pieces 
of evidence by means of the so-called (discrete) 
Choquet-integral. Our method, called Cho-k-NN, 
takes interdependencies between the stored cases 
into account and can be seen as a generalization of 
weighted nearest neighbor estimation.

	Abstract = {
We explore the effect of contamination of intermediate-redshift Type Ia
supernova samples by Type Ibc supernovae (SNe). Simulating observed
samples of Type Ia and mixed Type Ibc/Ia populations at a range of
redshifts for an underlying cosmological concordance model
(Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.27, Omega<SUB>lambda</SUB>=0.73), we find
that even small contamination levels, 2%-5%, may bias the derived
Omega<SUB>lambda</SUB> and Omega<SUB>M</SUB> toward larger values.
We thus emphasize the need for clean samples of Type Ia SNe for accurate
measurements of the cosmological parameters. We also simulate a SN
sample similar to the fiducial SNAP detected distribution of Kim and
coworkers, but include Type Ibc contamination. For this distribution we
illustrate the effect of Type Ibc contamination on the distance modulus
versus redshift diagram for low- and high-precision measurements.

	Abstract = {Deterministic simulation models are used in many areas of science, engineering, and policy making. Typically, these are complex models that attempt to capture underlying mechanisms in considerable detail, and they have many user-specified inputs. The inputs are often specified by some form of trial-and-error approach in which plausible values are postulated, the corresponding outputs inspected, and the inputs modified until plausible outputs are obtained. Here we address the issue of more formal inference for such models. A probabilistic approach, called Bayesian synthesis, was shown to suffer from the Borel paradox, according to which the results can depend on the parameterization of the model. We propose a modified approach, called Bayesian melding, which takes into full account information and uncertainty about both inputs and outputs to the model, while avoiding the Borel paradox. This is done by recognizing the existence of two priors, one implicit and one explicit, on each input and output; these are combined via logarithmic pooling. Bayesian melding is then standard Bayesian inference with the pooled prior on inputs, and is implemented here by posterior simulation using the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR) algorithm. We develop this initially for invertible models, and then extend it to the more difficult and more common case of noninvertible models. We illustrate the methodology using a number of examples. Simulation studies show that the method outperforms a simpler Bayesian approach in terms of mean squared error. A number of open research problems are discussed.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that P-values and the tests based upon them give unsatisfactory results, especially in large samples. It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

@article{Gibbons:2008,
	Abstract = {Model averaging is a group of methods for combining predictions from several models which have the benefit of considering model uncertainty in addition to parameter uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to introduce these methods in the context of mechanistic model development. In model averaging predictions are combined, by weighting with factors related to model performance, resulting in ensemble predictions. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is model averaging in a Bayesian framework where the model weights are Posterior model probabilities (PMPs). We describe three approximation methods (AIC, BIC and Laplace) for calculating PMPs and to compare with a full Bayesian approach implemented using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (Metropolis--Hastings). We also describe a simplified BMA approach which is readily implemented, as it only requires the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihoods. We illustrate the application of BMA using a mechanistic model for predicting the plant uptake of radiocaesium from contaminated soils (the `Absalom Model'). Ten models were selected for averaging, these comprised the full Absalom model and nine reduced models each derived from the full model. To assess performance model predictions and ensemble predictions were compared using an independent data set. The PMPs estimated using the MCMC approach and the Laplace approximation were similar and strongly weighted the models with fewer parameters. The AIC- and BIC-based estimates of the PMPs were correlated but differed considerably from the Laplace and MCMC-based PMP methods. For our example the simplified BMA approach was performed as well as the full approach. Individual predictions differed among models and the prediction ensembles resulting from all the approaches captured this uncertainty. We conclude that BMA is a valuable approach, relevant to mechanistic model development, and suggest a framework for incorporating BMA into model development.},

	Abstract = {
An analysis of SN Ia events in early-type galaxies from the database of
Cappellaro and coworkers provides conclusive evidence that the rate of
SNe Ia in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the rate
measured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e., SN Ia rate(radio-loud
galaxies)=0.43<SUP>+0.19</SUP><SUB>-0.14</SUB>
h<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>75</SUB> SNu as compared to SN Ia rate(radio-quiet
galaxies)=0.11<SUP>+0.06</SUP><SUB>-0.03</SUB>
h<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>75</SUB> SNu. The actual value of the enhancement is
likely to be in the range ~2-7 (P~10<SUP>-4</SUP>). This finding puts on
robust empirical grounds the results obtained by Della Valle &#38;
Panagia on the basis of a smaller sample of SNe. We analyze the possible
causes of this result and conclude that the enhancement of the SN Ia
explosion rate in radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being
strong radio sources, but there is no causal link between the two
phenomena. We argue that repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers
of early-type galaxies with dwarf companions, on timescales of about 1
Gyr, are responsible for both inducing strong radio activity observed in
~14% of early-type galaxies and supplying an adequate number of SN Ia
progenitors to the stellar population of elliptical galaxies.

@article{Hamuy:1995,
	Abstract = {
We have constructed Hubble diagrams in B and V for 13 Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) found in the course of the Calan/Tololo survey covering an
unprecedented range in redshift (0.01 less than Z less than 0.1). As
opposed to other published Hubble diagrams, these are solely based on
light curves obtained with CCDs, which have been carefully reduced in
order to avoid background contamination. Special care was also taken in
the extrapolation of peak magnitudes for the SNe that were discovered
after maximum light by using five different template light curves
representing the range of observed decline rates of SNe Ia. The
resulting Hubble diagrams show clear evidence for a distance-dependent
dispersion. Although some of the scatter could be due to the peculiar
velocities of the host galaxies or to uncorrected dust absorption in the
host galaxies, we argue that the dominant source is an intrinsic
dispersion in the peak absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia of approximately
0.8 mag in M<SUB>B</SUB> and approximately 0.5 mag in M<SUB>V</SUB>. If
low-luminosity events like SN 1991bg are actually a separate class of
supernovae which arise from different progenitors, then the intrinsic
dispersion in M<SUB>B</SUB> and M<SUB>V</SUB> for normal SNe Ia would
decrease to approximately 0.3-0.5 mag. This study confirms, in general
terms, the finding by Phillips (1993) from a sample of well observed
nearby SNe Ia that the absolute B and V magnitudes are correlated with
the initial decline rate of the B light curve, although this effect
seems to be less pronounced in the Calan/Tololo SNe. Although the number
of SNe studied here is relatively small, we find that galaxies having a
younger stellar population appear to host the most luminous SNe Ia. We
present Hubble diagrams in B and V for the subset of the Calan/Tololo
SNe which have decline rates in the range 0.8 less than Delta
m<SUB>15</SUB>(B) less than 1.5. A dramatic decrease in the scatter in
these diagrams is obtained when the data are corrected for the peak
luminosity-decline rate relation derived from events in the Phillips
sample of nearby SNe Ia covering the same range of decline rates. Using
the recently measured Cepheid distance to NGC 5253, a Hubble constant in
the range H<SUB>0</SUB> approximately equal to 62-67 km/s/Mpc is
calculated when the peak luminosity-decline rate relation is taken into
account. The result of ignoring this effect for SN 1972E is to
underestimate H<SUB>0</SUB> by approximately 15%.

	Abstract = {
We study the effect of environment on the properties of Type Ia
supernovae by analyzing the integrated spectra of 57 local Type Ia
supernova host galaxies. We deduce from the spectra the metallicity,
current star formation rate, and star formation history of the host and
compare these to the supernova decline rates. Additionally, we compare
the host properties to the difference between the derived supernova
distance and the distance determined from the best-fit Hubble law. From
this we investigate possible uncorrected systematic effects inherent in
the calibration of Type Ia supernova luminosities using light-curve
fitting techniques. Our results indicate a statistically insignificant
correlation in the direction of higher metallicity spiral galaxies
hosting fainter Type Ia supernovae. However, we present qualitative
evidence suggesting that progenitor age is more likely to be the source
of variability in supernova peak luminosities than is metallicity. We do
not find a correlation between the supernova decline rate and host
galaxy absolute B magnitude, nor do we find evidence of a significant
relationship between decline rate and current host galaxy star formation
rate. A tenuous correlation is observed between the supernova Hubble
residuals and host galaxy metallicities. Further host galaxy
observations will be needed to refine the significance of this result.
Finally, we characterize the environmental property distributions for
Type Ia supernova host galaxies through a comparison with two larger,
more general galaxy distributions using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The
results show the host galaxy metallicity distribution to be similar to
the metallicity distributions of the galaxies of the NFGS and SDSS.
Significant differences are observed between the SN Ia distributions of
absolute B magnitude and star formation histories and the corresponding
distributions of galaxies in the NFGS and SDSS. Among these is an abrupt
upper limit observed in the distribution of star formation histories of
the host galaxy sample, suggesting a Type Ia supernovae characteristic
delay time lower limit of approximately 2.0 Gyr. Other distribution
discrepancies are investigated and the effects on the supernova
properties are discussed.

We use integrated colors and B and V absolute magnitudes of Type Ia
supernova (SN) host galaxies in order to search for environmental
effects on the SN optical properties. With the new sample of 44 SNe we
confirm the conclusion by Hamuy et al. that bright events occur
preferentially in young stellar environments. We find also that the
brightest SNe occur in the least luminous galaxies, a possible
indication that metal-poor neighborhoods produce the more luminous
events. The interpretation of these results is made difficult, however,
because of the fact that galaxies with younger stellar populations are
also lower in luminosity. In an attempt to remove this ambiguity, we use
models for the line strengths in the absorption spectrum of five
early-type galaxies, in order to estimate metallicities and ages of the
SN host galaxies. With the addition of abundance estimates from nebular
analysis of the emission spectra of three spiral galaxies, we find
possible further evidence that luminous SNe are produced in metal-poor
neighborhoods. Further spectroscopic observations of the SN host
galaxies will be necessary to test these results and assist in
disentangling the age and metallicity effects on Type Ia SNe.

The frequency of supernovae of type Ia per unit infrared luminosity is
found to be an order of magnitude higher in late-type spirals than it is
in early-type galaxies. Presently available data also suggest, but do
not yet prove, that the SN Ia rate in amorphous/I0 galaxies may be even
higher than it is in normal late-type spirals. These results might be
accounted for by assuming that the rate at which intermediate-age
binaries containing white dwarfs evolve into SN Ia is much higher than
that for old white-dwarf binaries. The implications of this result for
the evolution of elliptical galaxies are briefly discussed.

An examination of recent observational material reveals substantial
differences between supernovae of Type Ia (SNs Ia) in galaxies of
different Hubble types. We propose that SNs Ia in late- and early-type
galaxies may have different progenitors. A further examination of novae
in galaxies of different Hubble types suggests the possibility that SNs
Ia in late-type galaxies may be related to cataclysmic variable-type
systems, while SNs Ia in early-type galaxies may be related to
mechanisms involving an older population. About 50% to 70% of the SNs Ia
events in spirals observed at the La Silla and Tololo Observatories in
the past 4 years appear to be located in the arms of the parent galaxy.

@article{Sullivan:2006a,
	Abstract = {
We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both very
young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on
the stellar mass and mean star formation rates (SFRs) of their host
galaxies. Models in which the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy
stellar mass are ruled out with &gt;99% confidence. Our analysis is
based on 100 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically
classified events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and
distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75. We estimate stellar masses and SFRs
for the SN Ia host galaxies by fitting their broadband spectral energy
distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code P&#201;GASE.2.
We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the
specific SFR of the parent galaxies-more vigorously star-forming
galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to
the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later type galaxies seen in the
local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple
``two-component'' model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate
linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the
mean SFRs of the host systems. We find that the SN Ia rate can be well
represented as the sum of 5.3+/-1.1&#215;10<SUP>-14</SUP> SNe
yr<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> and
3.9+/-0.7&#215;10<SUP>-4</SUP> SNe yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (M<SUB>solar</SUB>
yr<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP> of star formation. We also demonstrate a
dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star formation in the
host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with
no star formation, preferentially host faster declining/dimmer SNe Ia,
while brighter events are found in systems with ongoing star formation.

@article{Yoon:2007,
	Abstract = {
We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two
carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a
0.9M<SUB>solar</SUB> + 0.6M<SUB>solar</SUB> CO white dwarf merger is
followed by a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. The
calculation uses a state-of-the-art equation of state that is coupled to
an efficient nuclear reaction network that accurately approximates all
stages from helium burning up to nuclear statistical equilibrium. We use
an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially
absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH
particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we
suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has
reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially
rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a
rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported
disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of
the SPH simulation using a 1D hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and
then follow its secular evolution, where we include the effects of
rotation on the stellar structure and the transport of angular momentum.
The influence of the Keplerian disc is implicitly treated by considering
mass accretion from the disc on to the hot envelope. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled
by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot
envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided
despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the
assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in
previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger
remnants may not be appropriate. Specifically we find that off-centre
carbon ignition, which would eventually lead to the collapse of the
remnant to a neutron star, can be avoided if the following conditions
are satisfied. (1) When the merger remnant reaches quasi-static
equilibrium, the local maximum temperature at the interface between the
core and the envelope must be lower than the critical limit for carbon
ignition. (2) Angular momentum loss from the central merger remnant
should not occur on a time-scale shorter than the local neutrino cooling
time-scale at the interface. (3) The mass accretion rate from the
centrifugally supported disc must be sufficiently low to
10<SUP>-5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be
considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In
this case, the characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical
merger and the eventual explosion would be ~10<SUP>5</SUP>yr.

	Abstract = {
Type Ia supernovae are exploding stars that are used to measure the
accelerated expansion of the Universe and are responsible for most of
the iron ever produced. Although there is general agreement that the
exploding star is a white dwarf in a binary system, the exact
configuration and trigger of the explosion is unclear, which could
hamper their use for precision cosmology. Two families of progenitor
models have been proposed. In the first, a white dwarf accretes material
from a companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass, collapses and
explodes. Alternatively, two white dwarfs merge, again causing
catastrophic collapse and an explosion. It has hitherto been impossible
to determine if either model is correct. Here we report the discovery of
an object in pre-supernova archival X-ray images at the position of the
recent type Ia supernova (2007on) in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1404.
Deep optical images (also archival) show no sign of this object. From
this we conclude that the X-ray source is the progenitor of the
supernova, which favours the accretion model for this supernova,
although the host galaxy is older (6-9Gyr) than the age at which the
explosions are predicted in the accreting models.

Type Ia supernovae are important cosmological distance indicators. Each
of these bright supernovae supposedly results from the thermonuclear
explosion of a white dwarf star that, after accreting material from a
companion star, exceeds some mass limit, but the true nature of the
progenitor star system remains controversial. Here we report the
spectroscopic detection of circumstellar material in a normal type Ia
supernova explosion. The expansion velocities, densities, and dimensions
of the circumstellar envelope indicate that this material was ejected
from the progenitor system. In particular, the relatively low expansion
velocities suggest that the white dwarf was accreting material from a
companion star that was in the red-giant phase at the time of the
explosion.

	Abstract = {
We report results of a systematic radial velocity survey for double
degenerate (DD) binaries as potential progenitors of type Ia supernovae:
SPY (ESO Supernovae Ia Progenitor surveY). More than 1000 white dwarfs
(WDs) and pre-white dwarfs were observed with the VLT. The aim of SPY is
to perform a statistically significant test of the DD scenario. We give
an overview of the project and follow-up results. The sample is used for
two tests of the contemporary picture of close binary evolution leading
to DDs. It is shown that the SPY observations of low mass He-core WDs
(HeWDs) are inconsistent with the idea that they all reside in close
binary systems. We carry out a model atmosphere analysis of WDs residing
in double-lined binaries and estimate individual cooling ages. For a
number of systems the younger (and hotter) component is the less massive
one, as expected. However, for some systems the mass ratio is inverted.

	Abstract = {
Doubly-degenerate binary systems consisting of two white dwarfs (WDs)
both composed of carbon and oxygen and close enough that mass is
transferred from the less massive to the more massive are possible
progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. If the mass-transfer rate is slow
enough that the accreting WD can reach a mass of 1.38 M<SUB>solar</SUB>,
then it can ignite carbon degenerately at its centre. This can lead to a
thermonuclear runaway and hence a supernova explosion. However, if the
accretion rate is too high the outer layers of the WD heat up too much
and carbon ignites there non-degenerately. A series of mild carbon
flashes can then propagate inwards and convert the carbon to neon
relatively gently. There is no thermonuclear runaway and no supernova.
We examine the critical accretion rate at which ignition switches from
the centre to the surface for a variety of WDs and find it to be about
two-fifths of the Eddington rate. In a real binary star, the
mass-transfer rate falls off as mass transfer proceeds and the system
widens. Even if the initial transfer rate is high enough for carbon to
ignite at the outer edge, if such rapid accretion were to persist, we
find that it can extinguish if the rate drops sufficiently quickly. The
interior of the WD remains carbon rich and, if sufficient mass can still
be transferred from the companion, it can eventually ignite degenerately
at the centre. The primary WD must be about 1.1M<SUB>solar</SUB> or
above and the companion about 0.3M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Though WDs of such
low mass are expected to be pure helium, we note that a star of initial
mass 2.5M<SUB>solar</SUB> has a CO core of about 0.3M<SUB>solar</SUB>
when it begins to ascend the asymptotic giant branch. Alternatively, if
the accretion rate can be limited to a maximum of 0.46 of the Eddington
rate, then a 1.1-M<SUB>solar</SUB> WD accretes sufficiently slowly to
explode from a companion WD of any large enough mass.

@article{Iben:1993,
	Abstract = {
The characteristics of many close, evolved binaries can be understood
most easily if there exists some agency that can abstract angular
momentum or mass, or both, from the precursor system. Close binaries may
be defined as systems in which at least one of the components has filled
or will fill its Roche lobe and attempt to transfer matter to its
companion. If the time scale for mass transfer is considerably shorter
than the time scale on which the accretor can adjust thermally to the
proffered mass, the accreted layer will heat up, expand, and fill the
Roche lobe of the accretor. The mass lost by the donor thereafter flows
into a 'common envelope' (CE) which encompasses both stars. The
frictional interaction between this common envelope and the stellar
cores produces drag forces that cause the cores to spiral in toward one
another; some of the orbital energy helps drive matter from the CE into
interstellar space. Examples of systems which are experiencing or have
experienced this process include some planetary nebulae, cataclysmic
variables, and close binary degenerate stars. Similar situations can
arise if one of the components can support, of its own accord, a dense
wind that flows out of the system; the drag luminosity produced by
interaction between the companion and the wind may intensify the wind
and contribute to mass loss from the donor. Systems undergoing this
'wind-CE' process include novae and close binaries containing an OB
star. Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars are actually
ejected CEs, and precursors of many cataclysmic variables were once the
central stars of planetary nebulae formed in a CE event. In this review,
we (1) describe various initial configurations which will produce a CE,
(2) discuss the physics of the CE event, (3) describe attempts to model
the event quantitatively, and (4) apply what we have learned to
describe, in several real situations, the transformations wrought by
evolution through a CE phase.

	Abstract = {
Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) are thought to come from carbon oxygen white dwarfs
that accrete mass from binary companions until they approach the
Chandrasekhar limit, ignite carbon, and undergo complete thermonuclear
disruption. A survey of the observed types of binaries that contain
white dwarfs is presented. We propose that certain systems that seem
most promising as SN Ia progenitors should be more intensively observed
and modeled, to determine whether the white dwarfs in these systems will
be able to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. In view of the number of
promising single-degenerate systems and the dearth of promising
double-degenerate systems, we suspect that single-degenerates produce
most or perhaps all SNe Ia, while double-degenerates produce some or
perhaps none.

Formation frequencies of binary systems which may become Type I

degenerate dwarf and a (potential) mass donor (main-sequence star = MS;
low-mass red giant = RG; asymptotic giant branch star = AGB; CO or He

evolution (E), capture from wind (W), a magnetic stellar wind (MSW), or
gravitational wave radiation (GWR). For several scenarios, the

	Abstract = {
Tidal mass transfer in double degenerate systems is explored. The
sequence of double white dwarfs divides naturally into three segments:
(1) low-mass helium/helium pairs are unstable to dynamical time-scale
mass transfer and probably coalesce to form helium-burning sdO stars;
(2) in helium/carbon-oxygen pairs, mass transfer occurs on the time
scale for gravitational radiation losses; the accreted helium is quickly
ignited, and the accretor expands to dimensions characteristic of R CrB
stars, engulfing its companion star; and (3) carbon-oxygen/carbon-oxygen
pairs are again unstable to dynamical time-scale mass transfer and,
since their total masses exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, are destined to
become supernovae. Inactive lifetimes in these latter systems between
creation and interaction can exceed 10 billion years. Birthrates of R
CrB stars and Type I supernovae by evolution of double white dwarfs are
in reasonable agreement with observational estimates.

	Abstract = {
We propose a new model for progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae. The
model consists of an accreting white dwarf and a lobe-filling, low-mass
red giant. When the mass accretion rate exceeds a certain critical rate,
there is no static envelope solution on the white dwarf. For this case,
we find a new strong wind solution, which replaces the static envelope
solution. Even if the mass-losing star has a deep convective envelope,
the strong wind stabilizes the mass transfer until the mass ratio, q,
between the mass-losing star and the mass-accreting white dwarf reaches
1.15, i.e., q &lt; 1.15. A part of the transferred matter can be
accumulated on the white dwarf at a rate that is limited to M dot cr =
9.0 x 10-7 (MWD/Msolar - 0.50) Msolar yr-1, and the rest is blown off in
the wind. The photospheric temperature is kept around T ~ 1 x 105--2 x
105 K during the wind phase. After the wind stops, the temperature
quickly increases up to ~1 x 106 K. The white dwarf steadily burns
hydrogen and accretes helium, thereby being able to increase its mass up
to 1.38 Msolar and explode as a Type Ia supernova. The expected birth
rate of this type of supernovae is consistent with the observed rate of
Type Ia supernovae. The hot white dwarf may not be observed during the
strong wind phase due to self-absorption by the wind itself. The Strong
wind stops when the mass transfer rate decreases below M dot cr. Then it
can be observed as a supersoft X-ray source.

@article{Plewa:2004,
	Abstract = {
We present a new mechanism for Type Ia supernova explosions in massive
white dwarfs. The scenario follows from relaxing assumptions of symmetry
and involves a detonation born near the stellar surface. The explosion
begins with an essentially central ignition of a deflagration that
results in the formation of a buoyancy-driven bubble of hot material
that reaches the stellar surface at supersonic speeds. The bubble
breakout laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This
material, confined by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the
stellar surface and is focused at the location opposite to the point of
the bubble breakout. These streams of nuclear fuel carry enough mass and
energy to trigger a detonation just above the stellar surface that will
incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The
stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes mass in a way
that ensures production of intermediate-mass and iron group elements
with ejecta having a strongly layered structure and a mild amount of
asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase. This asymmetry,
combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by details of
the evolution (principally the energetics of deflagration, timing of
detonation, and structure of the progenitor), can be expected to create
a family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.

	Abstract = {
We study a type Ia supernova explosion using three-dimensional numerical
simulations based on reactive fluid dynamics. We consider a
delayed-detonation model that assumes a deflagration-to-detonation
transition. In contrast with the pure deflagration model, the
delayed-detonation model releases enough energy to account for a healthy
explosion, and does not leave carbon, oxygen, and intermediate-mass
elements in central parts of a white dwarf. This removes the key
disagreement between simulations and observations, and makes a delayed
detonation the mostly likely mechanism for type Ia supernovae.

We present the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
of the subsonic thermonuclear burning phase in type Ia supernovae. The
burning front model contains no adjustable parameters so that variations
of the explosion outcome can be linked directly to changes in the
initial conditions. In particular, we investigate the influence of the
initial flame geometry on the explosion energy and find that it appears
to be weaker than in 2D. Most importantly, our models predict global
properties such as the produced nickel masses and ejecta velocities
within their observed ranges without any fine tuning.

@article{Branch:1995,
	Abstract = {
We review the candidate progenitor binary systems of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). We argue that the exploding star is likely to be a mass
accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf. "Primary" characteristics of SNe
Ia, such as the composition of the ejected matter as a function of the
ejection velocity, depend on whether th efirst nuclear ignition takes
place in carbon-oxygen at or near the center of a Chandrasekhar-mass
white dwarf, or off-center, in a helium layer of a sub-Chandrasekhar
white dwarf. The primary characteristics of SNe Ia, as inferred from
observation, favor carbon ignitors rather than helium ignitors.
"Secondary" characteristics of SNe Ia that are determined by the nature
of the donor star and the accretion process tend to be environmental,
i.e., having to do with a circumstellar medium. We consider seven
candidate progenitor systems for carbon ignitors as well as four
candidate systems for helium ignitors, and we discuss the feasibility of
identifying the progenitor systems by means of observations of the
secondary characteristics of SNe Ia. The most promising tests at present
appear to be searches for radio emission, to constrain the circumstellar
density, and for narrow lines of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen in
early and late time spectra, to determine the composition of the donor
star. We conclude with reasons for suspecting that the coalescence of
pairs of C-O white dwarfs, and the accretion of hydgrogen on a thermal
timescale via Roche lobe overflow from subgiant donors, are the two most
promising candidate progenitors of SNe Ia. (SECTION: Invited Review

We present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (UV), optical, and
near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical
spectra, for the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005cf. The optical
photometry, performed at eight different telescopes, shows a 1sigma
scatter of lsim0.03 mag after proper corrections for the instrument
responses. From the well-sampled light curves, we find that SN 2005cf
reached a B-band maximum at 13.63 &#177; 0.02 mag, with an observed
luminosity decline rate Deltam <SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.05 &#177; 0.03
mag. The correlations between the decline rate and various color
indexes, recalibrated on the basis of an expanded SN Ia sample, yield a
consistent estimate for the host-galaxy reddening of SN 2005cf, E(B
-- V)<SUB>host</SUB> = 0.10 &#177; 0.03 mag. The UV photometry
was obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Swift
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, and the results match each other to
within 0.1-0.2 mag. The UV light curves show similar evolution to the
broadband U, with an exception in the 2000-2500 &#197; spectral range
(corresponding to the F220W/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears
broader and much fainter than that on either side (likely owing to the
intrinsic spectral evolution). Combining the UV data with the
ground-based optical and NIR data, we establish the generic
UV-optical-NIR bolometric light curve for SN 2005cf and derive the
bolometric corrections in the absence of UV and/or NIR data. The overall
spectral evolution of SN 2005cf is similar to that of a normal SN Ia,
but with variety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines.
The spectra at early times displayed strong, high-velocity (HV) features
in the Ca&#160;II H&#38;K doublet and NIR triplet, which were distinctly
detached from the photosphere (v &ap; 10,000 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>) at
a velocity ranging from 20,000 to 25,000 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>. One
interesting feature is the flat-bottomed absorption observed near 6000
&#197; in the earliest spectrum, which rapidly evolved into a
triangular shape and then became a normal Si&#160;II lambda6355
absorption profile at about one week before maximum brightness. This
premaximum spectral evolution is perhaps due to the blending of the
Si&#160;IIlambda6355 at photospheric velocity and another HV
absorption component (e.g., an Si&#160;II shell at a velocity ~18,000 km
s<SUP>--1</SUP>) in the outer ejecta, and may be common in other
normal SNe Ia. The possible origin of the HV absorption features is
briefly discussed.

We undertake a theoretical study of the near-infrared (NIR) light curves
of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In these bands, the light curves are
distinguished by a secondary maximum occurring roughly 20-30 days after
the initial one. Using time-dependent multigroup radiative transfer
calculations, we calculate the UBVRIJHK-band light curves of model SN Ia
ejecta structures. Our synthetic NIR light curves show distinct
secondary maxima and provide favorable fits to observed SNe Ia. We offer
a detailed explanation of the origin of the NIR secondary maximum, which
is shown to relate directly to the ionization evolution of iron group
elements in the ejecta. This understanding provides immediate insight
into the dependence of the NIR light curves on the physical properties
of the ejecta and in particular explains why brighter supernovae have a
later and more prominent secondary maximum. We demonstrate the
dependence of the NIR light curves on the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, the
degree of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing, the mass of electron capture elements,
the progenitor metallicity, and the abundance of intermediate-mass
elements (especially calcium). The secondary maximum is shown to be a
valuable diagnostic of these important physical parameters. The models
further confirm that SNe Ia should be excellent standard candles in the
NIR, with a dispersion of &lt;~0.2 mag even when the physical properties
of the ejecta are varied widely. This study emphasizes the consummate
value of NIR observations in probing the structure of SNe Ia and in
furthering their cosmological utility.

	Abstract = {
The diversity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) photometry is explored using
a grid of 130 one-dimensional models. It is shown that the observable
properties of SNe Ia resulting from Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are
chiefly determined by their final composition and some measure of
``mixing'' in the explosion. A grid of final compositions is explored,
including essentially all combinations of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, stable
``iron,'' and intermediate-mass elements that result in an unbound white
dwarf. Light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculated for each
model using two different approaches to the radiation transport problem.
Within the resulting templates are models that provide good photometric
matches to essentially the entire range of observed SNe Ia. On the
whole, the grid of models spans a wide range in B-band peak magnitudes
and decline rates, and does not obey a Phillips relation. In particular,
models with the same mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni show large variations in
their light-curve decline rates. We identify and quantify the additional
physical parameters responsible for this dispersion and consider
physically motivated ``cuts'' of the models that agree better with the
Phillips relation, discussing why nature may have preferred these
solutions. For example, models that produce a constant total mass of
burned material of 1.1+/-0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> do give a crude Phillips
relation, albeit with much scatter. If one further severely mixes the
ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 M<SUB>solar</SUB> (as might
be the case in a delayed-detonation scenario) reasonable agreement with
the Phillips relation results, although still with considerable spread.
We conclude that the supernova models that occur most frequently in
nature are highly constrained by the Phillips relation and that a large
part of the currently observed scatter in the relation is likely a
consequence of the intrinsic diversity of these objects.

Brighter Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have broader, more slowly declining
B-band light curves than dimmer SNe Ia. We study the physical origin of
this width-luminosity relation (WLR) using detailed radiative transfer
calculations of Chandrasekhar-mass SN Ia models. We find that the
luminosity dependence of the diffusion time (emphasized in previous
studies) is in fact of secondary relevance in understanding the model
WLR. Instead, the essential physics involves the luminosity dependence
of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe Ia. Following maximum light,
the SN colors are increasingly affected by the development of numerous
Fe II/Co II lines that blanket the B band and, at the same time,
increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia are
generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe III to Fe II
recombination in the iron group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a
more rapid evolution of the SN colors to the red. The faster B-band
decline rate of dimmer SNe Ia thus reflects their faster ionization
evolution.

We develop an analytic solution of the radiation transport problem for
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and show that it reproduces bolometric light
curves produced by more detailed calculations under the assumption of a
constant-extinction coefficient. This model is used to derive the
thermal conditions in the interior of SNe Ia and to study the
sensitivity of light curves to various properties of the underlying
supernova explosions. Although the model is limited by simplifying
assumptions, it is adequate for demonstrating that the relationship
between SNe Ia maximum-light luminosity and rate of decline is most
easily explained if SNe Ia span a range in mass. The analytic model is
also used to examine the size of various terms in the transport equation
under conditions appropriate to maximum light. For instance, the
Eulerian and advective time derivatives are each shown to be of the same
order of magnitude as other order v/c terms in the transport equation.
We conclude that a fully time-dependent solution to the transport
problem is needed in order to compute SNe Ia light curves and spectra
accurate enough to distinguish subtle differences of various explosion
models.

We examine the nature of the opacity and radiation transport in Type Ia
supernovae. The dominant opacity arises from line transitions. We
discuss the nature of line opacities and diffusion in expanding media
and the appropriateness of various mean and expansion opacities used in
light-curve calculations. Fluorescence is shown to be the dominant
physical process governing the rate at which energy escapes the
supernova. We present a sample light curve that was obtained using a
time-dependent solution of the radiative transport equation with a
spectral resolution of 80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and employing an LTE
equation of state. The result compares favorably with light curves and
spectra of typical supernovae and is used to illustrate the physics

By coupling observations of type Ia supernovae with results obtained
from the best available numerical models we constrain the Hubble
constant, independently of any external calibrators. We find an absolute
lower limit of H<SUB>0</SUB> &gt; 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>.
In addition, we construct a Hubble diagram with UVOIR light curves of 12
type Ia supernovae located in the Hubble flow, and when adopting the
most likely values (obtained from 1-D and 3-D deflagration simulations)
of the amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni produced in a typical event, we find
values of H<SUB>0</SUB> >= 66 &#177; 8 and >=78 &#177; 9 km
s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. Our result may be
difficult to reconcile with recent discussions in the literature as it
seems that an Einstein-de Sitter universe requires H<SUB>0</SUB> ~=
46 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> in order to fit the temperature
power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and maintain the age
constraints of the oldest stars.

The immediate progenitor of a Type I supernova (SN I) is thought to be a
mass-accreting carbon-oxygen (C-O) white dwarf in a binary system. In
the supernova explosion the C-O fuel is partly incinerated to
radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. The optical luminosity results from the
trapping and thermalization of the gamma rays and positrons emitted by
the decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni through <SUP>56</SUP>Co to <SUP>56</SUP>Fe.
The authors estimate the amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized and the
corresponding peak luminosity of a SN I from the model. This estimate is
combined with the observed Hubble diagram of SN I to derive the value of
the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB>. It is found that H<SUB>0</SUB> is in
the range 39 - 73 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> with a best estimate
of 59 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>.

@article{Contardo:2000,
	Abstract = {
We present empirical fits to the UBVRI light curves of type Ia
supernovae. These fits are used to objectively evaluate light curve
parameters. We find that the relative times of maximum light in the
filter passbands are very similar for most objects. Surprisingly the
maximum at longer wavelengths is reached earlier than in the B and V
light curves. This clearly demonstrates the complicated nature of the
supernova emission. Bolometric light curves for a small sample of
well-observed SNe Ia are constructed by integration over the optical
filters. In most objects a plateau or inflection is observed in the
light curve about 20-40 days after bolometric maximum. The strength of
this plateau varies considerably among the individual objects in the
sample. Furthermore the rise times show a range of several days for the
few objects which have observations early enough for such an analysis.
On the other hand, the decline rate between 50 and 80 days past maximum
is remarkably similar for all objects, with the notable exception of SN
1991bg. The similar late decline rates for the supernovae indicate that
the energy release at late times are very uniform; the differences at
early times are likely due to the radiation diffusing out of the ejecta.
With the exception of SN 1991bg, the range of absolute bolometric
luminosities of SNe Ia is found to be at least a factor of 2.5. The
nickel masses derived from this estimate range from 0.4 to 1.1 M<SUB>sun
</SUB>. It seems impossible to explain such a mass range by a single
explosion mechanism, especially since the rate of gamma -ray escape at
late phases seems to be very uniform.

The hypothesis that the optical luminosity of Type 1 supernovae results
from the radioactive decay of Ni56 synthesized and ejected by the
explosion was investigated by numerical simulation of the optical
spectrum resulting from a homologously expanding shell composed
initially of pure Ni56. This model, which neglects the effects of
material external to the Ni56 core, is expected to provide a reasonable
representation of the supernova at late times when the star is nearly
transparent to optical photons. The numerical simulation determines the
temperature, ionization state, and non-LTE level populations which
result from energy deposition by the radioactive decay products of Ni56
and Co56. The optical spectrum includes the effects of both allowed and
forbidden lines.

@article{Bowers:1997,
	Abstract = {
We present near-infrared (NIR) spectra for Type Ia supernovae at epochs
of 13 to 338d after maximum blue light. Some contemporary optical
spectra are also shown. All the NIR spectra exhibit considerable
structure throughout the J, H and K bands. In particular, they exhibit a
flux `deficit' in the J band which persists as late as 175d. This is
responsible for the well-known red J-H colour. To identify the emission
features and test the ^56Ni hypothesis for the explosion and subsequent
light curve, we compare the NIR and optical nebular-phase data with a
simple non-LTE nebular spectral model. We find that many of the spectral
features are due to iron-group elements, and that the J-band deficit is
due to a lack of emission lines from species that dominate the rest of
the IR/optical spectrum. Nevertheless, some emission is unaccounted for,
possibly due to inaccuracies in the cobalt atomic data. For some
supernovae, blueshifts of 1000-3000 km s^-1 are seen in infrared and
optical features at 3 months. We suggest that this is due to clumping in
the ejecta. The evolution of the cobalt/iron mass ratio indicates that
^56Co-decay dominates the abundances of these elements. The absolute
masses of iron-group elements which we derive support the basic
thermonuclear explosion scenario for Type Ia supernovae. A core-collapse
origin is less consistent with our data.

We present 432 low-dispersion optical spectra of 32 Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) that also have well-calibrated light curves. The coverage

obtained with the 1.5 m Tillinghast telescope at the F. L. Whipple
Observatory with typical wavelength coverage of 3700-7400 &#197; and a
resolution of ~7 &#197;. The earliest spectra are 13 days before B-band
maximum; two-thirds of the SNe were observed before maximum brightness.
Coverage for some SNe continues almost to the nebular phase. The
consistency of the method of observation and the technique of reduction
makes this an ideal data set for studying the spectroscopic diversity of
SNe Ia.<p/>

The most luminous Supernova SN2006gy (more than 100 times brighter than
a typical supernova) has been a challenge to explain by standard models.
For example, pair-instability supernovae which are luminous enough seem
to have too slow a rise, and core-collapse supernovae do not seem to be
luminous enough. We present an alternative scenario involving a Quark
Nova (an explosive transition of the newly born neutron star to a quark
star) in which a second explosion (delayed) occurs inside the ejecta of
a normal supernova. The reheated supernova ejecta can radiate at higher
levels for longer periods of time primarily due to reduced
adiabatic-expansion losses, unlike the standard supernova case. We find
an encouraging match between the resulting light curve and that observed
in the case of SN2006gy suggesting that we might have at hand the first
ever signature of a Quark Nova. Successful application of our model to
SN2005gj and SN2005ap is also presented.

We present unfiltered photometric observations with ROTSE-III and
optical spectroscopic follow-up with HET and the Keck telescope of the
most luminous supernova yet identified, SN 2005ap. The spectra taken
about 3 days before and 6 days after maximum light show narrow emission
lines (likely originating in the dwarf host) and absorption lines at a
redshift of z=0.2832, which puts the peak unfiltered magnitude at
-22.7+/-0.1 absolute. Broad P Cygni features corresponding to Halpha,
C III, N III, and O III are further detected with a photospheric
velocity of ~20,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Unlike other highly luminous
supernovae such as 2006gy and 2006tf that show slow photometric
evolution, the light curve of SN 2005ap indicates a 1-3 week rise to
peak followed by a relatively rapid decay. The spectra also lack the
distinct emission peaks from moderately broadened (FWHM ~2000 km
s<SUP>-1</SUP>) Balmer lines seen in SN 2006gy and SN 2006tf. We briefly
discuss the origin of the extraordinary luminosity from a strong
interaction as may be expected from a pair instability eruption or a
GRB-like engine encased in a H/He envelope.

The recent detection of Halpha emission in the Type Ia supernova SN
2002ic could be taken to mean that the elusive progenitor systems of
Type Ia supernovae have finally been identified. At first glance, the
observation appears to support a single-degenerate scenario, in which
the white dwarf accretes from a normal companion. In this Letter we show
that the opposite may be true, and the observations may support the
merger of two white dwarfs as the cause for Type Ia supernovae.

Stars that explode as supernovae come in two main classes. A type Ia
supernova is recognized by the absence of hydrogen and the presence of
elements such as silicon and sulphur in its spectrum; this class of
supernova is thought to produce the majority of iron-peak elements in
the Universe. They are also used as precise `standard candles' to
measure the distances to galaxies. While there is general agreement that
a type Ia supernova is produced by an exploding white dwarf star, no
progenitor system has ever been directly observed. Significant effort
has gone into searching for circumstellar material to help discriminate
between the possible kinds of progenitor systems, but no such material
has hitherto been found associated with a type Ia supernova. Here we
report the presence of strong hydrogen emission associated with the type
Ia supernova SN2002ic, indicating the presence of large amounts of
circumstellar material. We infer from this that the progenitor system
contained a massive asymptotic-giant-branch star that lost several solar
masses of hydrogen-rich gas before the supernova explosion.

We report Nearby Supernova Factory observations of SN 2005gj, the second
confirmed case of a ``hybrid'' Type Ia/IIn supernova, which we interpret
as the explosion of a white dwarf interacting with a circumstellar
medium. Our early-phase photometry of SN 2005gj shows that the
interaction is much stronger than for the prototype, SN 2002ic. Our
first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad and narrow Halpha
emission. Later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst, show
clear Type Ia features combined with broad and narrow Hgamma, Hbeta,
Halpha, and He I lambdalambda5876, 7065 in emission. At higher
resolution, P Cygni profiles are apparent. Surprisingly, we also observe
an inverted P Cygni profile for [O III] lambda5007. We find that the
light curve and measured velocity of the unshocked circumstellar
material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. The early light
curve is well described by a flat radial density profile for the
circumstellar material. However, our decomposition of the spectra into
Type Ia and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of
the supernova, suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the
circumstellar material. We suggest that the emission-line velocity
profiles arise from electron scattering rather than the kinematics of
the shock. This is supported by the inferred high densities and the lack
of evidence for evolution in the line widths. Ground- and space-based
photometry and Keck spectroscopy of the host galaxy are used to
ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity
(Z/Z<SUB>solar</SUB>&lt;0.3 95% confidence) and that this galaxy is
undergoing a significant star formation event that began roughly
200+/-70 Myr ago. We discuss the implications of these observations for
progenitor models and cosmology using Type Ia supernovae.

	Abstract = {
With an extinction-corrected V-band peak absolute magnitude of about
-22, supernova SN 2006gy is probably the brightest SN ever observed. We
report on multiwavelength observations of this SN and its environment.
Our spectroscopy shows an Halpha emission line as well as absorption
features that may be identified as Si II lines at low expansion
velocity. The slow brightening, the peak luminosity, and the Halpha
emission line resemble those observed in hybrid Type IIn/Ia SNe (also
known as Type IIa) and may suggest that SN 2006gy is related to the Type
IIa SNe class. The host galaxy, NGC 1260, is dominated by an old stellar
population with solar metallicity. However, our high-resolution adaptive
optics images reveal a dust lane in this galaxy, and there appears to be
an H II region in the vicinity of the SN. The extraordinarily large peak
luminosity, ~3 &#215; 10<SUP>44</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>, demands a
dense circumstellar medium, regardless of the mass of the progenitor
star. The inferred mass-loss rate of the progenitor is ~0.1
M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> over a period of ~10 yr prior to
explosion. Such an high mass-loss rate may be the result of a binary
star common envelope ejection. The total radiated energy in the first 2
months is about 1.1 &#215; 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs, which is only a factor
of 2 less than that available from a super-Chandrasekhar Type Ia
explosion. Therefore, given the presence of a star-forming region in the
vicinity of the SN and the high-energy requirements, a plausible
scenario is that SN 2006gy is related to the death of a massive star.

We present Keck spectropolarimetry of the unusual Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) 2005hk several days before maximum light. An analysis of the high
signal-to-noise ratio total-flux spectrum shows the object's extreme
similarity to the peculiar SN 2002cx. SN 2005hk has an optical spectrum
dominated by Fe  III lines and only weak lines of intermediate-mass
elements, unlike a normal SN Ia at this epoch. The photospheric velocity
measured from the minima of strong absorption lines is very low for an
SN Ia (~6000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), solidifying the connection to SN
2002cx. The spectrum-synthesis code SYNOW was used to identify the
presence of iron-peak elements, intermediate-mass elements, and possibly
unburned carbon at similar velocities in the outer ejecta of SN 2005hk.
Many weak spectral features remain unidentified. The spectropolarimetry
shows a low level of continuum polarization (~0.4%) after correction for
the interstellar component, and only a weak Fe III line feature is
detected. The level of continuum polarization is normal for an SN Ia,
implying that the unusual features of SN 2005hk cannot be readily
explained by large asymmetries.

We present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well as
optical spectra of the peculiar supernova (SN) 2008ha. SN&#160;2008ha
had a very low peak luminosity, reaching only&#160;M<SUB>V</SUB> =
--14.2&#160;mag, and low line velocities of only ~2000&#160;km
s<SUP>--1</SUP> near maximum brightness, indicating a very small
kinetic energy per unit mass of ejecta. Spectroscopically,
SN&#160;2008ha is a member of the SN&#160;2002cx-like class of SNe, a
peculiar subclass of SNe&#160;Ia however, SN&#160;2008ha is the most
extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower line
velocities than the typical member, which is already ~2&#160;mag fainter
and has line velocities ~5000&#160;km s<SUP>--1</SUP> smaller (near
maximum brightness) than a normal SN&#160;Ia. SN&#160;2008ha had a
remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantly shorter than
either SN&#160;2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal SNe&#160;Ia
(~19.5 days). The bolometric light curve of SN&#160;2008ha indicates
that SN&#160;2008ha peaked at L <SUB>peak</SUB> = (9.5 &#177; 1.4)
&#215; 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>--1</SUP>, making SN&#160;2008ha
perhaps the least luminous SN ever observed. From its peak luminosity
and rise time, we infer that SN&#160;2008ha generated (3.0 &#177; 0.9)
&#215; 10<SUP>--3</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, had a
kinetic energy of ~2 &#215; 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, and ejected
0.15&#160;M <SUB>sun</SUB> of material. The host galaxy of
SN&#160;2008ha has a luminosity, star formation rate, and metallicity
similar to those of the Large&#160;magellanic Cloud. We classify three
new (and one potential) members of the SN&#160;2002cx-like class,
expanding the sample to 14 (and one potential) members. The host-galaxy
morphology distribution of the class is consistent with that of
SNe&#160;Ia, Ib, Ic, and II. Several models for generating
low-luminosity SNe can explain the observations of SN&#160;2008ha
however, if a single model is to describe all SN&#160;2002cx-like
objects, deflagration of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, with SN&#160;2008ha
being a partial deflagration and not unbinding the progenitor star, is
preferred. The rate of SN&#160;2008ha-like events is ~10% of the
SN&#160;Ia rate, and in the upcoming era of transient surveys, several
thousand similar objects may be discovered, suggesting that
SN&#160;2008ha may be the tip of a low-luminosity transient iceberg.

photometry and optical spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN)
2005hk. These data reveal that SN 2005hk was nearly identical in its
observed properties to SN 2002cx, which has been called ``the most
peculiar known Type Ia supernova.'' Both supernovae exhibited
high-ionization SN 1991T-like premaximum spectra, yet low peak
luminosities like that of SN 1991bg. The spectra reveal that SN 2005hk,
like SN 2002cx, exhibited expansion velocities that were roughly half
those of typical Type Ia supernovae. The R and I light curves of both
supernovae were also peculiar in not displaying the secondary maximum
observed for normal Type Ia supernovae. Our YJH photometry of SN 2005hk
reveals the same peculiarity in the near-infrared. By combining our
optical and near-infrared photometry of SN 2005hk with published
ultraviolet light curves obtained with the Swift satellite, we are able
to construct a bolometric light curve from ~15 days before to ~60 days
after B maximum. The shape and unusually low peak luminosity of this
light curve, plus the low expansion velocities and absence of a
secondary maximum at red and near-infrared wavelengths, are all in
reasonable agreement with model calculations of a three-dimensional
deflagration that produces ~0.2 M<SUB>solar</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni.<p/>

We present Keck optical spectra of SN 2002cx, the most peculiar known
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), taken 227 and 277 days past maximum light.
Astonishingly, the spectra are not dominated by the forbidden emission
lines of iron that are a hallmark of thermonuclear SNe in the nebular
phase. Instead, we identify numerous P Cygni profiles of Fe II at very
low expansion velocities of ~700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are without
precedent in SNe Ia. We also report the tentative identification of
low-velocity O I in these spectra, suggesting the presence of unburned
material near the center of the exploding white dwarf. SN 2002cx is the
prototype of a new subclass of SNe Ia, with spectral characteristics
that may be consistent with recent pure deflagration models of
Chandrasekhar-mass thermonuclear SNe. These are distinct from the
majority of SNe Ia, for which an alternative explosion mechanism, such
as a delayed detonation, may be required.

In spite of the apparent lack of Si II and S II features in its spectra,
SN 2002cx was classified as a peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) on the
basis of its overall photometric and spectroscopic behavior. Spectra
obtained near maximum light contained Fe III features, as in SN
1991T-like events, but the blueshifts of the Fe III absorptions were
exceptionally low. The luminosity was also low. We use the supernova
synthetic-spectrum code SYNOW to study line identifications in SN
2002cx. We find that the maximum-light spectra appear to contain weak
features of Si II, S II, Si III, and Ca II, which strengthens the
connection with SN 1991T-like events. We show that later spectra
obtained 12, 25, and 56 days after maximum consist of P Cygni
resonance-scattering features due to permitted Fe II and Co II lines. SN
2002cx had been thought to have made the transition from a
permitted-line to a forbidden-line spectrum between 25 and 56 days.
Owing to the low expansion velocities, the postmaximum spectral features
are narrower and easier to identify than they are in other SNe Ia. SN
2002cx will lead to improved line identifications in other SNe Ia and
will clarify when the transition from a permitted- to a forbidden-line
spectrum occurs. In the context of current SN Ia explosion models, we
suggest that the properties of SN 2002cx might be consistent with
three-dimensional deflagration models, which are not favored for normal
SNe Ia.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN)
2002cx, which reveal it to be unique among all observed Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia). SN 2002cx exhibits an SN 1991T-like premaximum
spectrum, an SN 1991bg-like luminosity, and expansion velocities roughly
half those of normal SNe Ia. Photometrically, SN 2002cx has a broad peak
in the R band and a plateau phase in the I band, and slow late-time
decline. The B-V color evolution is nearly normal, but the V-R and V-I
colors are very red. Early-time spectra of SN 2002cx evolve very quickly
and are dominated by lines from Fe-group elements; features from
intermediate-mass elements (Ca, S, Si) are weak or absent. Mysterious
emission lines are observed around 7000 &#197; at about 3 weeks after
maximum brightness. The nebular spectrum of SN 2002cx is also unique,
consisting of narrow iron and cobalt lines. The observations of SN
2002cx are inconsistent with the observed spectral/photometric sequence
and provide a major challenge to our understanding of SNe Ia. No
existing theoretical model can successfully explain all observed aspects
of SN 2002cx.

After defining what we mean by spectroscopically 'normal' and 'peculiar'
Type Ia supernova, we report the results of an attempt to sub-classify
84 SNe Ia either as normal or as like one of the recent, peculiar SNe
Ia: 1991T, 1991bg, or 1986G. Only SNe 1957A and 1960H are found to have
been certifiably abnormal, with SN 1957A; appearing to have been like SN
1991bg, and SN 1960H having been like SN 1991bg or SN 1988G; SNe 1971I
and 1980I are under suspicion of having been like SN 1986G, and SN 1988G
of having been like SN 1991T. Of the SNe Ia we have been able to
classify either as normal or as peculiar, 89% (or 83%, counting those
under suspicion as peculiar) are normal. Our main conclusion is that the
observational sample of SNe Ia is strongly peaked at 'spectroscopically
normal.' We further conclude that when arranged in the photometric
sequence of Phillips (1993) SNe Ia also form a spectroscopic sequence,
and that peculiar SNe Ia are over-represented in the Phillips sample.

Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 1991bg, a very peculiar
Type Ia supernova in the outskirts or the E1 galaxy NGC 4374 in the
Virgo cluster, are reported. The spectra and light curves demonstrate
that SN 1991bg is an intrinsically subluminous, photometrically and
spectroscopically discrepant object. In some respects it is similar to
the peculiar SNe Ia 1986G in Cen A and 1971I in NGC 5055. It is
suggested that the observed properties of these mavericks are associated

In this Letter we present evidence for a spectral sequence among Type Ia
supernovae (SN Ia's). The sequence is based on the systematic variation
of several features seen in the near-maximum light spectrum. This
sequence is analogous to the recently noted photometric sequence among
SN Ia's which shows a relationship between the peak brightness of a SN
Ia and the shape of its light curve. In addition to the observational
evidence we present a partial theoretical explanation for the sequence.
This has been achieved by producing a series of non-LTE synthetic
spectra in which only the effective temperature is varied. The synthetic
sequence nicely reproduces most of the differences seen in the observed
one and presumably corresponds to the amount of 56Ni produced in the
explosion.

SN 1991T was a peculiar object whose premaximum optical spectrum did not
resemble that of any known SN; it appears to have been dominated by
lines of iron-group elements. Near maximum brightness, however, lines of
intermediate-mass elements slowly appeared, and the spectrum began to
resemble that of Type Ia supernovae (SNs Ia). With time, the spectral
similarity to classical SNs Ia grew progressively stronger. Two months
after the explosion, the spectrum was once again dominated by iron-group
elements and appeared almost identical to that of typical SNs Ia. At
visual wavelengths, SN 1991T was probably greater than about 0.6 mag
more luminous than classical SNs Ia, but the shape of its light curve
was reasonably normal. It is suggested that SN 1991T was a double
detonation of a white dwarf, initiated at the boundary layer between the
carbon-oxygen core and the helium envelope. Alternatively, the explosion
may have been the result of a delayed detonation in a carbon-oxygen
white dwarf.

Mean light curves of Type I, II-P ("plateau"), and II-L ("linear")
supernovae are plotted on a common scale and directly compared. The Type
II-P light curve has a distinctive shape, but the shape of Type II-L
bears a resemblance to that of Type I in both the B and V bands. The
similarity raises the question of whether the underlying physics of Type
II-L explosions is more like that of Type I than like that of Type II-P,
contrary to the usual assumption. It is shown that for Tycho's and
Kepler's supernovae, light-curve shape cannot distinguish between a Type
I and Type II-L classification. The light curves of the principal
examples of Zwicky's Type III, IV, and V supernovae are compared
directly to the mean light curves of the main types. The authors suggest
that these supernovae be referred to as II-pec, for "Type II peculiar".

The focus of this review is the work that has been done during the 1990s
on using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure the Hubble constant
(H_0). SNe Ia are well suited for measuring (H_0). A straightforward
maximum-light color criterion can weed out the minority of observed
events that are either intrinsically subluminous or substantially
extinguished by dust, leaving a majority subsample that has
observational absolute-magnitude dispersions of less than
sigma_obs(M_B) ~= sigma_obs(M_V) ~= 0.3 mag. Correlations between
absolute magnitude and one or more distance-independent SN Ia or
parent-galaxy observables can be used to further standardize the
absolute magnitudes to better than 0.2 mag. The absolute magnitudes can
be calibrated in two independent ways: empirically, using Cepheid-based
distances to parent galaxies of SNe Ia, and physically, by light curve
and spectrum fitting. At present the empirical and physical calibrations
are in agreement at M_B ~= M_V ~= - 19.4 or - 19.5. Various ways that
have been used to match Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia or physical models to
SNe Ia that have been observed out in the Hubble flow have given values
of (H_0) distributed throughout the range of 54-67 km s^-1 Mpc^-1.
Astronomers who want a consensus value of (H_0) from SNe Ia with
conservative errors could, for now, use 60 +/- 10 km s^-1 Mpc^-1.

Type Ia Supernovae are in many aspects still enigmatic objects. Their
observational and theoretical exploration is in full swing, but we still
have plenty to learn about these explosions. Recent years have already
witnessed a bonanza of supernova observations. The increased samples
from dedicated searches have allowed the statistical investigation of
Type Ia Supernovae as a class. The observational data on Type Ia
Supernovae are very rich, but the uniform picture of a decade ago has
been replaced by several correlations which connect the maximum
luminosity with light curve shape, color evolution, spectral appearance,
and host galaxy morphology. These correlations hold across almost the
complete spectrum of Type Ia Supernovae, with a number of notable
exceptions. After 150 days past maximum, however, all observed objects
show the same decline rate and spectrum. The observational constraints
on explosion models are still rather sparse. Global parameters like
synthesized nickel mass, total ejecta mass and explosion energetics are
within reach in the next few years. These parameters bypass the
complicated calculations of explosion models and radiation transport.
The bolometric light curves are a handy tool to investigate the overall
appearance of Type Ia Supernovae. The nickel masses derived this way
show large variations, which combined with the dynamics from line
widths, indicate that the brighter events are also coming from more
massive objects. The lack of accurate distances and the uncertainty in
the correction for absorption are hampering further progress.
Improvements in these areas are vital for the detailed comparison of
luminosities and the determination of nickel masses. Coverage at
near-infrared wavelengths for a statistical sample of Type Ia Supernovae
will at least decrease the dependence on the absorption. Some of the
most intriguing features of Type Ia Supernovae are best observed at
these wavelengths, like the second peak in the light curve, the
depression in the J band, and the unblended [Feii] lines in the ashes.

@article{Leonard:2002a,
	Abstract = {
We present 30 optical spectra and 49 photometric epochs sampling the
first 517 days after discovery of supernova (SN) 1999em and derive its
distance through the expanding photosphere method (EPM). SN 1999em is
shown to be a Type II-plateau (II-P) event, with a photometric plateau
lasting until about 100 days after explosion. We identify the dominant
ions responsible for most of the absorption features seen in the optical
portion of the spectrum during the plateau phase. Using the weakest
unblended absorption features to estimate photospheric velocity, we find
the distance to SN 1999em to be D=8.2+/-0.6 Mpc, with an explosion date
of HJD 2,451,475.6+/-1.4, or 5.3+/-1.4 days before discovery. We show
that this distance estimate is about 10% closer than the distance that
results if the strong Fe II lambdalambda4924, 5018, 5169 absorption
features, which have often been used in previous EPM studies, are used
to estimate photospheric velocity. We examine potential sources of
systematic error in EPM-derived distances and find the most significant
to result from uncertainty in the theoretical modeling of the flux
distribution emitted by the SN photosphere (i.e., the ``flux dilution
factor''). We compare previously derived EPM distances to eight SNe II
in galaxies (or members of the same group) for which a recently revised
Cepheid distance exists from the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project and
find D<SUB>Cepheids</SUB>/D<SUB>EPM</SUB>=0.87+/-0.06 (statistical);
eliminating the three SNe II distances for which a Cepheid distance
exists only to a group member, and not the host galaxy itself, yields
D<SUB>Cepheids</SUB>/D<SUB>EPM</SUB>=0.96+/-0.09. Additional direct
comparisons, especially to spectroscopically and photometrically normal
SNe II-P, will certainly help to produce a more robust comparison.
Finally, we investigate the possible use of SNe II-P as standard candles
and find that for eight photometrically confirmed SNe II-P with
previously derived EPM distances and SN 1999em, the mean plateau
absolute brightness is M<SUB>V</SUB>(plateau)=-16.4+/-0.6 mag, implying
that distances good to ~30% (1 sigma) may be possible without the need
for a complete EPM analysis. At M<SUB>V</SUB>(plateau)=-15.9+/-0.2 mag,
SN 1999em is somewhat fainter than the average SN II-P. The general
consistency of absolute SNe II-P brightness during the plateau suggests
that the standard candle assumption may allow SNe II-P to be viable
cosmological beacons at z&gt;2.

Recent efforts to model the processes occurring in Type I and II

Both types of events release about the same amount of energy and produce
heavy elements. Features which distinguish the two types of supernovae
are summarized. Prominent stages in Type II events are reviewed,
including the presupernova evolution of massive stars, core collapse and
bounce. Processes occurring in a delayed explosion, e.g., failure of the
shock and possible formation of a 'neutrinosphere', are discussed, along
with nucleosynthesis during Type II explosions and features of peculiar

We present photometry and spectra of the Type IIP supernova 1999em in
NGC 1637 from several days after the outburst till day 642. The
radioactive tail of the recovered bolometric light curve of SN 1999em
indicates that the amount of the ejected <SUP>56</SUP>Ni is . The
Halpha and HeI 10830-&#197; lines at the nebular epoch show that the
distribution of the bulk of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni can be represented
approximately by a sphere of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni with a velocity of 1500 km
s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is shifted towards the far hemisphere by about 400
km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The fine structure of the Halpha at the
photospheric epoch reminiscent of the `Bochum event' in SN 1987A is
analysed in terms of two plausible models: bipolar <SUP>56</SUP>Ni jets
and non-monotonic behaviour of the Halpha optical depth combined with
the one-sided <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejection. The late-time spectra show a
dramatic transformation of the [OI] 6300-&#197; line profile between
days 465 and 510, which we interpret as an effect of dust condensation
during this period. Late-time photometry supports the dust formation
scenario after day 465. The [OI] line profile suggests that the dust
occupies a sphere with velocity ~800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and optical depth
&gt;&gt;10. The latter exceeds the optical depth of the dusty zone in SN
1987A by more than 10 times. Use is made of the Expanding Photosphere
Method to estimate the distance and the explosion time, D~ 7.83 Mpc and
t<SUB>0</SUB>~= 1999 October 24.5 UT, in accord with observational
constraints on the explosion time and with other results of detailed
studies of the method. The plateau brightness and duration combined with
the expansion velocity suggest a pre-supernova radius of 120-150
R<SUB>solar</SUB>, ejecta mass of 10-11 M<SUB>solar</SUB> and explosion
energy of (0.5-1) &#215; 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The ejecta mass combined
with the neutron star and a conservative assumption about mass loss
implies the main sequence progenitor of M<SUB>ms</SUB>~ 12-14
M<SUB>solar</SUB>. The derived mass range is in agreement with the upper
limit to the mass found using pre-supernova field images by Smartt et
al. From the [OI] 6300, 6364 &#197; doublet luminosity we infer the
oxygen mass to be a factor four lower than in SN 1987A which is
consistent with the estimated SN 1999em progenitor mass according to
nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution theory. We note a `second-plateau'
behaviour of the light curve after the main plateau at the beginning of
the radioactive tail. This feature seems to be common to SNe IIP with
low <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass.

spectral features. SN 2008ax displays the ordinary spectral evolution of
a Type IIb supernova. A stringent pre-discovery limit constrains the
time of the shock breakout of SN 2008ax to within only a few hours. Its
light curve, which peaks in the B band about 20 d after the explosion,
strongly resembles that of other He-rich core-collapse supernovae. The
observed evolution of SN 2008ax is consistent with the explosion of a
young Wolf-Rayet (of WNL type) star, which had retained a thin, low-mass
shell of its original H envelope. The overall characteristics of SN
2008ax are reminiscent of those of SN 1993J, except for a likely smaller
H mass. This may account for the findings that the progenitor of SN
2008ax was a WNL star and not a K supergiant as in the case of SN 1993J,
that a prominent early-time peak is missing in the light curve of SN
2008ax, and that Halpha is observed at higher velocities in SN 2008ax
than in SN 1993J.

We present X-ray, broad-band optical and low-frequency radio
observations of the bright type IIP supernova SN 2004et. The Chandra
X-ray Observatory observed the supernova at three epochs, and the
optical coverage spans a period of ~470 d since explosion. The X-ray
emission softens with time, and we characterize the X-ray luminosity
evolution as L<SUB>X</SUB> ~ t<SUP>-0.4</SUP>. We use the observed X-ray
luminosity to estimate a mass-loss rate for the progenitor star of ~2
&#215; 10<SUP>-6</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The optical
light curve shows a pronounced plateau lasting for about 110 d. Temporal
evolution of photospheric radius and colour temperature during the
plateau phase is determined by making blackbody fits. We estimate the
ejected mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni to be 0.06 +/- 0.03M<SUB>solar</SUB>.
Using the expressions of Litvinova &#38; Nad&#235;zhin we estimate an
explosion energy of (0.98 +/- 0.25) &#215; 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We also
present a single epoch radio observation of SN 2004et. We compare this
with the predictions of the model proposed by Chevalier, Fransson &#38;
Nymark. These multiwavelength studies suggest a main-sequence progenitor
mass of ~20 M<SUB>solar</SUB> for SN 2004et.

We present optical photometry of one Type IIn supernova (1994Y) and nine
Type Ia supernovae (1993Y, 1993Z, 1993ae, 1994B, 1994C, 1994M, 1994Q,
1994ae, and 1995D). SN 1993Y and SN 1993Z appear to be normal SN Ia
events with similar rates of decline, but we do not have data near
maximum brightness. The colors of SN 1994C suggest that it suffers from
significant reddening or is intrinsically red. The light curves of SN
1994Y are complicated; they show a slow rise and gradual decline near
maximum brightness in VRI and numerous changes in the decline rates at
later times. SN 1994Y also demonstrates color evolution similar to that
of the SN IIn 1988Z, but it is slightly more luminous and declines more
rapidly than SN 1988Z. The behavior of SN 1994Y indicates a small ejecta
mass and a gradual strengthening of the Halpha emission relative to
the continuum.

We present contemporaneous optical and infrared (IR) photometric
observations of the Type IIn SN 1998S covering the period between 11 and
146d after discovery. The IR data constitute the first ever IR light
curves of a Type IIn supernova. We use blackbody and spline fits to the
photometry to examine the luminosity evolution. During the first 2-3
months, the luminosity is dominated by the release of shock-deposited
energy in the ejecta. After ~100d the luminosity is powered mostly by
the deposition of radioactive decay energy from
0.15+/-0.05M<SUB>solar</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni which was produced in
the explosion. We also report the discovery of an astonishingly high IR
excess, K-L'=2.5, that was present at day 130. We interpret this as
being due to thermal emission from dust grains in the vicinity of the
supernova. We argue that to produce such a high IR luminosity so soon
after the explosion, the dust must be pre-existing and so is located in
the circumstellar medium of the progenitor. The dust could be heated
either by the UV/optical flash (IR echo) or by the X-rays from the
interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar material.

	Abstract = {
We present the BVR photometry and the spectra of SN 1998S taken about
four months after discovery, beginning a week and 6 days before maximum
brightness respectively. The light curves show a steep and linear
decline, which are consistent with those of SN 1979C and are typical of
a SN II-L. An absolute magnitude at maximum
M<SUB>B</SUB><SUP>0</SUP>&lt;= -18.7 is derived, which is more than 2
mag brighter than the regular SNII and indicates this SN is a member of
the rare class of Bright SNII. The B-V color evolution at early epoch is
also typical of linear SN II with a maximum (B-V) value of +1.35,
similar to the typical Type II-L SN 1980K. The spectral evolution is
typical for SN II-L, very similar to that of the SN 1979C. They,
however, showed some differences. The spectrum before maximum showed
high-ionization N III and He II emission lines superposed on a strong
blue continuum. Around the maximum light the high-ionization emission
lines disappeared, leaving weak H I, He I emission lines, which are
similar to those of SN 1983K. The extraordinary feature on the
post-maximum spectra is the narrow emission P Cygni profile superposed
on a much broader P Cygni structure in all five Balmer lines, Halpha
to Hepsilon . Such feature is reminiscent of the post-maximum spectra of
SN 1984E. Rapid spectral and photometric evolution, together with the
presence of obvious P Cygni profile, suggests that SN 1998S is more
consistent with the nature of a type II-L supernova than that of a IIn
supernova, although narrow lines are present on the premaximum spectrum.

We report 139 photometric observations through the B, V, and I filters
of the supernova SN 1998bw, an object which is associated with the
gamma-ray burst GRB 980425. Detailed light curves of this unique
supernova can be compared with theoretical models, so we report here our
light curve for 123 days between 1998 June 27 and 1998 October 28. The
light curve of SN 1998bw is consistent with those of the Type Ic class.
We find that the magnitude versus time relation for this supernova is
linear to within 0.05 mag in all colors over the entire duration of our
study. Our measured uniform decline rates are 0.0141+/-0.0002,
0.0184+/-0.0003, and 0.0181+/-0.0003 mag per day in the B, V, and I
bands. The linear decline and the rate of that decline suggest that the
late-time light curve is powered by the radioactive decay of cobalt with
some leakage of the gamma rays.

The discovery of afterglows associated with gamma-ray bursts at X-ray,
optical and radio wavelengths and the measurement of the redshifts of
some of these events, has established that gamma-ray bursts lie at
extreme distances, making them the most powerful photon-emitters known
in the Universe. Here we report the discovery of transient optical
emission in the error box of the gamma-ray burst GRB980425, the light
curve of which was very different from that of previous optical
afterglows associated with gamma-ray bursts. The optical transient is
located in a spiral arm of the galaxy ESO184-G82, which has a redshift
velocity of only 2,550kms<SUP>-1 </SUP> (ref. 6). Its optical spectrum
and location indicate that it is a very luminous supernova, which has
been identified as SN1998bw. If this supernova and GRB980425 are indeed
associated, the energy radiated in gamma-rays is at least four orders
of magnitude less than in other gamma-ray bursts, although its
appearance was otherwise unremarkable: this indicates that very
different mechanisms can give rise to gamma-ray bursts. But
independent of this association, the supernova is itself unusual,
exhibiting an unusual light curve at radio wavelengths that requires
that the gas emitting the radio photons be expanding relativistically,.

We present the first high-redshift Hubble diagram for Type II-P
supernovae (SNe II-P) based on five events at redshift up to z~0.3. This
diagram was constructed using photometry from the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey and absorption-line spectroscopy from
the Keck Observatory. The method used to measure distances to these
supernovae is based on recent work by Hamuy &#38; Pinto and exploits a
correlation between the absolute brightness of SNe II-P and the
expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the Fe II lambda5169
P Cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. We present three
refinements to this method that significantly improve the practicality
of measuring the distances of SNe II-P at cosmologically interesting
redshifts. These are an extinction correction measurement based on the
V-I colors at day 50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion
velocity, and the ability to extrapolate such velocities accurately over
almost the entire plateau phase. We apply this revised method to our
data set of high-redshift SNe II-P and find that the resulting Hubble
diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 mag, thus demonstrating the
feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with present facilities,
using a method independent of that based on supernovae of Type Ia.

	Abstract = {
Ongoing supernova (SN) surveys find hundreds of candidates that require
confirmation for their various uses. Traditional classification based on
follow-up spectroscopy of all candidates is virtually impossible for
these large samples. The use of Type Ia SNe as standard candles is at an
evolved stage that requires pure, uncontaminated samples. However, other
SN survey applications, such as measuring cosmic SN rates, could benefit
from a classification of SNe on a statistical basis, rather than case by
case. With this objective in mind, we have developed the SN-ABC, an
automatic Bayesian classifying algorithm for supernovae. We rely solely
on single-epoch multiband photometry and host-galaxy (photometric)
redshift information to sort SN candidates into the two major types, Ia
and core-collapse supernovae. We test the SN-ABC performance on
published samples of SNe from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and
GOODS projects that have both broadband photometry and spectroscopic
classification (so the true type is known). The SN-ABC correctly
classifies up to 97% (85%) of the Type Ia (II-P) SNe in SNLS, and
similar fractions of the GOODS SNe, depending on photometric redshift
quality. Using simulations with large artificial samples, we find
similarly high success fractions for Types Ia and II-P, and reasonable
(~75%) success rates in classifying Type Ibc SNe as core-collapse. Type
IIn SNe, however, are often misclassified as Type Ia. In deep surveys,
SNe Ia are best classified at redshifts z gtrsim 0.6 or when near
maximum. Core-collapse SNe (other than Type IIn) are best recognized
several weeks after maximum, or at z lesssim 0.6. Assuming the SNe are
young, as would be the case for rolling surveys, the success fractions
improve by a degree dependent on the type and redshift. The fractional
contamination of a single-epoch photometrically selected sample of SNe
Ia by core-collapse SNe varies between less than 10% and as much as 30%,
depending on the intrinsic fraction and redshift distribution of the
core-collapse SNe in a given survey. The SN-ABC also allows the
rejection of SN "impostors" such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with
half of the AGNs we simulate rejected by the algorithm. Our algorithm
also supplies a good measure of the quality of the classification, which
is valuable for error estimation.

We present optical and infrared photometry of the unusual Type Ia
supernova 2000cx. With the data of Li et al. and Jha, this constitutes
the largest data set ever assembled for a Type Ia SN, more than 600
points in UBVRIJHK. We confirm the finding of Li et al. regarding the
unusually blue B-V colors as SN 2000cx entered the nebular phase. Its
I-band secondary hump was extremely weak given its B-band decline rate.
The V minus near-infrared colors likewise do not match loci based on
other slowly declining Type Ia SNe, although V-K is the least
``abnormal.'' In several ways, SN 2000cx resembles other slow decliners,
given its B-band decline rate [Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)=0.93], the
appearance of Fe III lines and weakness of Si II in its premaximum
spectrum, the V-K colors, and postmaximum V-H colors. If the distance
modulus derived from surface brightness fluctuations of the host galaxy
is correct, we find that the rate of light increase prior to maximum,
the characteristics of the bolometric light curve, and the implied
absolute magnitude at maximum are all consistent with a subluminous
object with Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)~1.6-1.7 having a higher than normal
kinetic energy.

We present optical and/or infrared photometry of the Type Ia supernovae
SN 1991T, SN 1991bg, SN 1999ek, SN 2001bt, SN 2001cn, SN 2001cz, and SN
2002bo. All but one of these supernovae have decline rate parameters,
Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B), close to the median value of 1.1 for the whole
class of Type Ia supernovae. The addition of these supernovae to the
relationship between the near-infrared absolute magnitudes and
Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) strengthens the previous relationships we have
found in that the maximum light absolute magnitudes are essentially
independent of the decline rate parameter. (SN 1991bg, the prototype of
the subclass of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae, is a special case.)
The dispersion in the Hubble diagram in JHK is only ~0.15 mag. The
near-infrared properties of Type Ia supernovae continue to be excellent
measures of the luminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies
because of the need for only small corrections from the epoch of
observation to maximum light, low dispersion in absolute magnitudes at
maximum light, and the minimal reddening effects in the near-infrared.

	Abstract = {
Large samples of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) are potentially powerful
probes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment and SN physics. We
present initial results from a new deep SN survey, based on re-imaging
in the R,i', z' bands, of the 0.25deg<SUP>2</SUP> Subaru Deep Field
(SDF), with the 8.2-m Subaru telescope and Suprime-Cam. In a single new
epoch consisting of two nights of observations, we have discovered 33
candidate SNe, down to a z'-band magnitude of 26.3 (AB). We have
measured the photometric redshifts of the SN host galaxies, obtained
Keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies and classified
the SNe using the Bayesian photometric algorithm of Poznanski et al.
that relies on template matching. After correcting for biases in the
classification, 55 per cent of our sample consists of Type Ia SNe and 45
per cent of core-collapse SNe. The redshift distribution of the SNe Ia
reaches z ~ 1.6, with a median of z ~ 1.2. The core-collapse SNe reach z
~ 1.0, with a median of z ~ 0.5. Our SN sample is comparable to the
Hubble Space Telescope/Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)
sample in both size and redshift range. The redshift distributions of
the SNe in the SDF and in GOODS are consistent, but there is a trend
(which requires confirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z SNe
Ia in the SDF. This trend is also apparent when comparing the SN Ia
rates we derive to those based on GOODS data. Our results suggest a
fairly constant rate at high redshift that could be tracking the star
formation rate. Additional epochs on this field, already being obtained,
will enlarge our SN sample to the hundreds, and determine whether or not
there is a decline in the SN Ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

We present a measurement of the distant Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate
derived from the first 2 yr of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Supernova Legacy Survey. We observed four
1<SUP>deg</SUP>&#215;1<SUP>deg</SUP> fields with a typical temporal
frequency of &lt;Deltat&gt;~4 observer-frame days over time spans of
158-211 days per season for each field, with breaks during the full
Moon. We used 8-10 m class telescopes for spectroscopic follow-up to
confirm our candidates and determine their redshifts. Our starting
sample consists of 73 spectroscopically verified SNe Ia in the redshift
range 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6. We derive a volumetric SN Ia rate of
r<SUB>V</SUB>(&lt;z&gt;=0.47)=[0.42<SUP>+0.13</SUP><SUB>-0.09</SUB>(syst.)+/-0.06(stat.)&#215;10<SUP>-4</SUP>
yr<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>3</SUP>, assuming h=0.7,
Omega<SUB>m</SUB>=0.3, and a flat cosmology. Using recently published
galaxy luminosity functions derived in our redshift range, we derive a
SN Ia rate per unit luminosity of
r<SUB>L</SUB>(&lt;z&gt;=0.47)=0.154<SUP>+0.048</SUP><SUB>-0.033</SUB>(syst.)<SUP>+0.039</SUP><SUB>-0.031</SUB>(stat.)
SN units. Using our rate alone, we place an upper limit on the component
of SN Ia production that tracks the cosmic star formation history of 1
SN Ia per 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> of stars formed. Our rate and
other rates from surveys using spectroscopic sample confirmation display
only a modest evolution out to z=0.55.<p/>

We present the discovery of a distant methane dwarf, the first from the
Institute for Astronomy (IfA) Deep Survey. The object (``IfA 0230-Z1'')
was identified from deep optical I- and z<SUP>'</SUP>-band imaging,
being conducted as an IfA-wide collaboration using the prime-focus
imager Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2 m Telescope. IfA 0230-Z1 is
extremely red in the Iz<SUP>'</SUP>J (0.8-1.2 mum) bands but
relatively blue in J-H such colors are uniquely characteristic of T
dwarfs. A near-IR spectrum taken with the Keck Telescope shows strong
H<SUB>2</SUB>O absorption and a continuum break indicative of
CH<SUB>4</SUB>, confirming that the object has a very cool atmosphere.
Comparison with nearby T dwarfs gives a spectral type of T3-T4 and a
distance of ~45 pc. Simple estimates based on previous T dwarf
discoveries suggest that the IfA survey will find a comparable number of
T dwarfs as the 2 Micron All Sky Survey, albeit at a much larger average
distance. We also discuss the survey's ability to probe the Galactic
scale height of ultracool (L and T) dwarfs. Based on observations
obtained at the Subaru Telescope, Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF),
and W. M. Keck Observatory.

The U, B, V, and R light curves exhibit the typical forms of a Type I SN
and suggest that the maximum occurred on JD2444672 when the SN was at
B(max) = 12.00. The color indices (B-V) and (U-B) vary in systematic
fashion with time and follow closely the mean evolution found from
previous Type I SN by Pskovskii (1967, 1970, 1977). Assuming that the
absolute magnitude of SN 1981b is M<SUB>0(max)</SUB> = -18.5, based on
previous Type I SN on the zero point of the de Vaucouleurs distance
scale, then the distance modulus of NGC 4536 is 30.29; this is in
excellent agreement with the mean modulus, 30.1 + or - 0.3, derived from
eight tertiary and quaternary indicators on the same zero point. Both of
these values are about 1.5 m lower than the distance modulus that would
be derived from the redshift of the galaxy, even on the same zero point.

The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey consists of HST ACS imaging for 100
early-type galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, observed in the F475W (~SDSS
g) and F850LP (~SDSS z) filters. We derive distances for 84 of these
galaxies using the method of surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs),
present the SBF distance catalog, and use this database to examine the
three-dimensional distribution of early-type galaxies in the Virgo
Cluster. The SBF distance moduli have a mean (random) measurement error
of 0.07 mag (0.5 Mpc), or roughly 3 times better than previous SBF
measurements for Virgo Cluster galaxies. Five galaxies lie at a distance
of d~23 Mpc and are members of the W' cloud. The remaining 79 galaxies
have a narrow distribution around our adopted distance of
&lt;d&gt;=16.5+/-0.1 (random mean error) +/-1.1 Mpc (systematic). The
rms distance scatter of this sample is sigma(d)=0.6+/-0.1 Mpc, with
little or no dependence on morphological type or luminosity class (i.e.,
0.7+/-0.1 and 0.5+/-0.1 Mpc for the giants and dwarfs, respectively).
The back-to-front depth of the cluster measured from our sample of
early-type galaxies is 2.4+/-0.4 Mpc (i.e., +/-2 sigma of the
intrinsic distance distribution). The M87 (cluster A) and M49 (cluster
B) subclusters are found to lie at distances of 16.7+/-0.2 and
16.4+/-0.2 Mpc, respectively. There may be a third subcluster associated
with M86. A weak correlation between velocity and line-of-sight distance
may be a faint echo of the cluster velocity distribution not having yet
completely virialized. In three dimensions, Virgo's early-type galaxies
appear to define a slightly triaxial distribution, with axis ratios of
(1:0.7:0.5). The principal axis of the best-fit ellipsoid is inclined
~20&deg;-40&deg; from the line of sight, while the galaxies belonging to
the W' cloud lie on an axis inclined by ~10&deg;-15&deg;.<p/>

We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the
results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give
the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based
on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied
over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits
from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a
larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL)
relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2
(WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid
metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the
observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC
(relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of
mu<SUB>0</SUB>(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised
distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have
been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional
galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a
Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance
to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values
(in km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>) of H<SUB>0</SUB>=71+/-2
(random)+/-6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H<SUB>0</SUB>=71+/-3+/-7
(Tully-Fisher relation), H<SUB>0</SUB>=70+/-5+/-6 (surface brightness
fluctuations), H<SUB>0</SUB>=72+/-9+/-7 (Type II supernovae), and
H<SUB>0</SUB>=82+/-6+/-9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results
for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and
find good agreement and consistency with H<SUB>0</SUB>=72+/-8 km
s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Finally, we compare these results with
other, global methods for measuring H<SUB>0</SUB>. Based on observations

 We investigate how a different calibration of the Cepheid
period-luminosity (PL) relation, taking into account metallicity
corrections, affects the absolute magnitude calibration of Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) and, in turn, the determination of the Hubble
constant H<SUB>0</SUB>. We use SN Ia light curves from the literature
and previously unpublished data to establish the
M<SUB>B</SUB>-Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) relation, and calibrate the zero
point by means of nine SNe Ia with Cepheid-measured distances. This
relation is then used to establish the Hubble diagram, and in turn to
derive H<SUB>0</SUB>. In the attempt to correct for the host-galaxy
extinction, we find that the data suggest a value for the total to
selective absorption ratio of R<SUB>B</SUB>= 3.5, which is smaller than
the standard value for our own Galaxy of R<SUB>B</SUB>= 4.315.<p/>

Depending on the metallicity correction for the Cepheid PL relation, the
value of R<SUB>B</SUB>, and SN sample selection criteria, the value of
the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> takes a value in the range 68-74 km
s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, with associated uncertainties of the
order of 10 per cent.<p/>

Unpublished photometry is also presented for 18 SNe of our sample
(1991S, 1991T, 1992A, 1992K, 1993H, 1993L, 1994D, 1994M, 1994ae, 1995D,
1995ac, 1995bd, 1996bo, 1997bp, 1997br, 1999aa, 1999dk, 2000cx). These
data are the results of a long-standing effort in supernova monitoring
at ESO - La Silla and Asiago observatories.

	Abstract = {
Photometric (BVI) and redshift data corrected for streaming motions are
compiled for 111 ``Branch-normal,'' four 1991T-like, seven 1991bg-like,
and two unusual supernovae of Type Ia (SNe Ia). Color excesses
E(B-V)<SUB>host</SUB> of normal SNe Ia, due to the absorption of the
host galaxy, are derived by three independent methods, giving excellent
agreement leading to the intrinsic colors at maximum of
(B-V)<SUP>00</SUP>=-0.024+/-0.010 and (V-I)<SUP>00</SUP>=-0.265+/-0.016
if normalized to a common decline rate of Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>=1.1. The
strong correlation between redshift absolute magnitudes (based on an
arbitrary Hubble constant of H<SUB>0</SUB>=60 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>
Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>), corrected only for the extrinsic Galactic absorption,
and the derived E(B-V)<SUB>host</SUB> color excesses leads to the
well-determined yet abnormal absorption-to-reddening ratios of
R<SUB>BVI</SUB>=3.65+/-0.16, 2.65+/-0.15, and 1.35+/-0.21.
Comparison with the canonical Galactic values of 4.1, 3.1, and 1.8
forces the conclusion that the law of interstellar absorption in the
path length to the SN in the host galaxy is different from the local
Galactic law, a result consistent with earlier conclusions by others.
Improved correlations of the fully corrected absolute magnitudes (on the
same arbitrary Hubble constant zero point) with host galaxy
morphological type, decline rate, and intrinsic color are derived. We
recover the result that SNe Ia in E/S0 galaxies are ~0.3 mag fainter
than in spiral galaxies for possible reasons discussed in the text. The
new decline rate corrections to absolute magnitudes are smaller than
those by some authors for reasons explained in the text. The four
spectroscopically peculiar 1991T-type SNe are significantly overluminous
as compared to Branch-normal SNe Ia. The overluminosity of the seven
1999aa-like SNe is less pronounced. The seven 1991bg types in the sample
constitute a separate class of SNe Ia, averaging in B 2 mag fainter than
the normal Ia. New Hubble diagrams in B, V, and I are derived out to
~30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> using the fully corrected magnitudes and
velocities, corrected for streaming motions. Nine solutions for the
intercept magnitudes in these diagrams show extreme stability at the
0.02 mag level using various subsamples of the data for both low and
high extinctions in the sample, proving the validity of the corrections
for host galaxy absorption. We shall use the same precepts for fully
correcting SN magnitudes for the luminosity recalibration of SNe Ia in
the forthcoming final review of our Hubble Space Telescope Cepheid-SN
experiment for the Hubble constant.

1,042,618,261 objects derived from 3,643,201,733 separate observations.
The data were obtained from scans of 7435 Schmidt plates taken for the
various sky surveys during the last 50 years. USNO-B1.0 is believed to
provide all-sky coverage, completeness down to V=21, 0.2" astrometric
accuracy at J2000, 0.3 mag photometric accuracy in up to five colors,
and 85% accuracy for distinguishing stars from nonstellar objects. A

We present the new PyRAF-based `MultiDrizzle' script, which is aimed at
providing a one-step approach to combining dithered HST images. The
purpose of this script is to allow easy interaction with the complex
suite of tasks in the IRAF/STSDAS `dither' package, as well as the new
`PyDrizzle' task, while at the same time retaining the flexibility of
these tasks through a number of parameters. These parameters control the
various individual steps, such as sky subtraction, image registration,
`drizzling' onto separate output images, creation of a clean median
image, transformation of the median with `blot' and creation of cosmic
ray masks, as well as the final image combination step using `drizzle'.
The default parameters of all the steps are set so that the task will
work automatically for a wide variety of different types of images,
while at the same time allowing adjustment of individual parameters for
special cases. The script currently works for both ACS and WFPC2 data,
and is now being tested on STIS and NICMOS images. We describe the
operation of the script and the effect of various parameters,
particularly in the context of combining images from dithered
observations using ACS and WFPC2. Additional information is also
available at the `MultiDrizzle' home page:

	Abstract = {
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey has identified a large
number of new transient sources in a 300 deg<SUP>2</SUP> region along
the celestial equator during its first two seasons of a three-season
campaign. Multi-band (ugriz) light curves were measured for most of the
sources, which include solar system objects, galactic variable stars,
active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), and other astronomical
transients. The imaging survey is augmented by an extensive
spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their
redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their
environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light
curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of
the SNe, and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic
observations. In the first two seasons, 476 sources were selected for
spectroscopic observations, of which 403 were identified as SNe. For the
type Ia SNe, the main driver for the survey, our photometric typing and
targeting efficiency is 90%. Only 6% of the photometric SN Ia candidates
were spectroscopically classified as non-SN Ia instead, and the
remaining 4% resulted in low signal-to-noise, unclassified spectra. This
paper describes the search algorithm and the software, and the real-time
processing of the SDSS imaging data. We also present the details of the
supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow-up
spectroscopic and imaging observations of the discovered sources.

We present ugriz light curves for 146 spectroscopically-confirmed or
spectroscopically-probable Type Ia supernovae (SNe) from the 2005 season
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova (SN) survey. The light
curves have been constructed using a photometric technique that we call
scene modeling, which is described in detail here; the major feature is
that SN brightnesses are extracted from a stack of images without
spatial resampling or convolution of the image data. This procedure
produces accurate photometry along with accurate estimates of the
statistical uncertainty, and can be used to derive photometry taken with
multiple telescopes. We discuss various tests of this technique that
demonstrate its capabilities. We also describe the methodology used for
the calibration of the photometry, and present calibrated magnitudes and
fluxes for all of the spectroscopic SNe Ia from the 2005 season.

This special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters is dedicated to
presenting initial results from the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey (GOODS) that are primarily, but not exclusively, based on
multiband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The survey covers roughly 320
arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> in the ACS F435W, F606W, F814W, and F850LP bands,
divided into two well-studied fields. Existing deep observations from
the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and ground-based facilities are
supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared
from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National
Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope
Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being
released worldwide within 3-6 months of acquisition. Together, this data
set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and
active galaxies, supernovae, and faint stars in our own Galaxy. This
Letter serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific
data that have been used in the accompanying letters, summarizing the
reduction procedures and sensitivity limits.<p/>

We describe the IfA Deep Survey and the primary results from the
associated search for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The survey observed
&tilde;2.5 square degrees to a depth of m &ap; 25 26 in RIZ over 9 17
visits, typically every 1 3 weeks for nearly 5 months. We discovered 23
confirmed SNe Ia, including 15 at z >= 0.7, doubling the published
number of objects at these redshifts. These SNe provide corroboration
that the evidence that expansion of the universe is accelerating is
indeed due to cosmological effects rather than systematic effects
proportional to redshift. Adopting the constraint that Omega<SUB>
total</SUB> = 1.0, we obtain best-fit values of (Omega<SUB>
m</SUB>,Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>) = (0.33, 0.67). We develop several
new analytic techniques that promise to increase the power of future SN
surveys, including the N(N - 1)/2 method for constructing variable
object light-curves. We show how to obtain a best estimate of the
light-curve by performing all possible subtractions of pairs of images
and demonstrate that this method improves results over the standard
``single template'' procedure. We describe a method for
accurately determining luminosity distances to SNe Ia without knowledge
of redshift based on marginalizing over  z. We demonstrate that the
Hubble diagram scatter of distances from this technique is equal to that
using conventional redshift-specific methods, indicating that accurate
distances to SNe Ia may be determined without spectroscopic redshifts,
which are typically the limiting factor for the number of SNe that
surveys can collect. The nature of the IfA Deep Survey observations
means that we can identify SNe in a complete and unbiased way. We
describe the process by which we re-analyze the survey data to provide a
first look at the faint, variable universe, and provide a comprehensive
catalog of SNe in the survey fields. We investigate rates using the
complete sample of SNe produced by the above analysis. We observe a
steady increase in the rates of SNe Ia, interrupted by a single
discrepant point at z = 0.55 that may be partially attributable to
sample contamination. We find that there is no evidence for a
significant delay time between the star formation rate and the SN Ia
rate, indicating progenitor evolution may be short.

	Abstract = {
The first cosmological results from the ESSENCE supernova survey
(Wood-Vasey and coworkers) are extended to a wider range of cosmological
models including dynamical dark energy and nonstandard cosmological
models. We fold in a greater number of external data sets such as the
recent Higher-z release of high-redshift supernovae (Riess and
coworkers), as well as several complementary cosmological probes. Model
comparison statistics such as the Bayesian and Akaike information
criteria are applied to gauge the worth of models. These statistics
favor models that give a good fit with fewer parameters. Based on this
analysis, the preferred cosmological model is the flat cosmological
constant model, where the expansion history of the universe can be
adequately described with only one free parameter describing the energy
content of the universe. Among the more exotic models that provide good
fits to the data, we note a preference for models whose best-fit
parameters reduce them to the cosmological constant model.

We present multiepoch spectra of 13 high-redshift Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) drawn from the literature, the ESSENCE and SNLS projects, and
our own separate dedicated program on the ESO Very Large Telescope. We
use the Supernova Identification (SNID) code of Blondin and Tonry to
determine the spectral ages in the supernova rest frame. Comparison with
the observed elapsed time yields an apparent aging rate consistent with
the 1/(1+z) factor (where z is the redshift) expected in a homogeneous,
isotropic, expanding universe. These measurements thus confirm the
expansion hypothesis, while unambiguously excluding models that predict
no time dilation, such as Zwicky's ``tired light'' hypothesis. We also
test for power-law dependencies of the aging rate on redshift. The
best-fit exponent for these models is consistent with the expected
1/(1+z) factor.<p/>

Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal
Observatory under programs 67.A-0361, 267.A-5688, 078.D-0383, and
080.D-0477 at the Gemini Observatory and NOAO, which are operated by the
Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under
cooperative agreements with the NSF; with the Magellan Telescopes at Las
Campanas Observatory; and at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which was made
possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

Good representations of the passbands for the Johnson-Cousins UBVRI
system have been devised by comparing synthetic photometry with actual
observations and with standard system magnitudes. Small adjustments have
been made to previously published passbands. Users are urged to match
these passbands so that better photometry and calibration are ensured.
Mismatched B bands are shown to be a major source of recent (U - B)
transformation problems. The nature of systematic differences between
the natural colors of the most widely used sets of standard star
photometry is investigated and suggested CCD filter combinations are
discussed.

We present UBVRI photometry of 44 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed
from 1997 to 2001 as part of a continuing monitoring campaign at the
Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics. The data set comprises 2190 observations and is the
largest homogeneously observed and reduced sample of SNe Ia to date,
nearly doubling the number of well-observed, nearby SNe Ia with
published multicolor CCD light curves. The large sample of U-band
photometry is a unique addition, with important connections to SNe Ia
observed at high redshift. The decline rate of SN Ia U-band light curves
correlates well with the decline rate in other bands, as does the U-B
color at maximum light. However, the U-band peak magnitudes show an
increased dispersion relative to other bands even after accounting for
extinction and decline rate, amounting to an additional ~40% intrinsic
scatter compared to the B band.

	Abstract = {
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of 23
high-redshift supernovae (SNe) spanning a range of z=0.34-1.03, nine of
which are unambiguously classified as Type Ia. These SNe were discovered
during the IfA Deep Survey, which began in 2001 September and observed a
total of 2.5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> to a depth of approximately m~25-26 in RIZ
over 9-17 visits, typically every 1-3 weeks for nearly 5 months, with
additional observations continuing until 2002 April. We give a brief
description of the survey motivations, observational strategy, and
reduction process. This sample of 23 high-redshift SNe includes 15 at
z&gt;=0.7, doubling the published number of objects at these redshifts,
and indicates that the evidence for acceleration of the universe is not
due to a systematic effect proportional to redshift. In combination with
the recent compilation of Tonry et al. (2003), we calculate cosmological
parameter density contours that are consistent with the flat universe
indicated by the cosmic microwave background (Spergel et al. 2003).
Adopting the constraint that Omega<SUB>total</SUB>=1.0, we obtain
best-fit values of
(Omega<SUB>m</SUB>,Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>)=(0.33,0.67) using 22
SNe from this survey augmented by the literature compilation. We show
that using the empty-beam model for gravitational lensing does not
eliminate the need for Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>&gt;0. Experience from
this survey indicates great potential for similar large-scale surveys
while also revealing the limitations of performing surveys for z&gt;1
SNe from the ground.<p/>

The Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey has provided the deepest optical and
near-infrared views of the universe yet, and has enabled a search for
the most distant supernovae, to z~2.2. We have found four supernovae by
searching spans of integrations of the Ultra Deep Field and the Ultra
Deep Field Parallels taken with the Hubble Space Telescope paired with
the Advanced Camera for Surveys and with NICMOS. Interestingly, none of
these events were Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) above a redshift of 1.4,
despite the substantially increased sensitivity per unit area to such
objects over other surveys, including the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey. However, we find that the low frequency of SNe Ia observed
at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.4 is statistically consistent with current estimates of
the Type Ia supernova rate per unit volume, including the global star
formation history combined with the nontrivial assembly time of SN Ia
progenitors.

A theoretical analysis of the light curves of Type I supernovae is
presented. A low-mass helium star (helium mass of about 1.5 to 4 solar
masses), formed by mass transfer in a binary or by extensive mass loss,
undergoes core collapse to form a neutron star. The 'reflected' shock
synthesizes and ejects about 0.3 solar mass of Ni-56. The low-mass
mantle slows the Ni-56 but allows it to escape. The shock does not give
a vigorous display in the visual wavelengths because the envelope is not
sufficiently extended to do so. The decay of Ni-56 powers the peak of
the light curve; exponential-tail phase is powered by kinetic energy
from positron emission by Co-56. The Co-Fe 'core' lights a surrounding,
rapidly expanding, He-rich nebula. During the tail phase, the luminosity
in gamma-ray lines is about 20 times that observed in the visible, and
should be detectable with gamma-ray spectrometers now operational.

We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000
star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar
mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances
and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest
stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a
tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity
spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10
in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 10<SUP>8.5</SUP>
to 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>, in
good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but
flattens above 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We use indirect
estimates of the gas mass based on the Halpha luminosity to compare
our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution
models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic
mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted
than L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is
not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as
high as 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We interpret this as strong
evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness
in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.

@article{Timmes:2003,
	Abstract = {
We explore the idea that the observed variations in the peak
luminosities of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) originate in part from a
scatter in metallicity of the main-sequence stars that become white
dwarfs. Previous numerical studies have not self-consistently explored
metallicities greater than solar. One-dimensional Chandrasekhar mass
models of SNe Ia produce most of their <SUP>56</SUP>Ni in a burn to
nuclear statistical equilibrium between the mass shells 0.2 and 0.8
M<SUB>solar</SUB>, for which the electron-to-nucleon ratio Y<SUB>e</SUB>
is constant during the burn. We show analytically that under these
conditions, charge and mass conservation constrain the mass of
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni produced to depend linearly on the original metallicity
of the white dwarf progenitor. Detailed postprocessing of W7-like models
confirms this linear dependence. The effect that we have identified is
most evident at metallicities larger than solar and is in agreement with
previous self-consistent calculations over the metallicity range common
to both calculations. The observed scatter in the metallicity (1/3-3
Z<SUB>solar</SUB>) of the solar neighborhood is enough to induce a 25%
variation in the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejected by SNe Ia. This is
sufficient to vary the peak V-band brightness by
|DeltaM<SUB>V</SUB>|~0.2. This scatter in metallicity is present out
to the limiting redshifts of current observations (z&lt;~1).
Sedimentation of <SUP>22</SUP>Ne can possibly amplify the variation in
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass to &lt;~50%. Further numerical studies can
determine if other metallicity-induced effects, such as a change in the
mass of the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-producing region, offset or enhance the
variation that we identify.

We use the HST ACS imaging of the two GOODS fields during Cycles 11, 12,
and 13 to derive the Type Ia supernova rate in four redshift intervals
in the range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.8. Compared to our previous results based on
Cycle 11 observations only, we have increased the coverage of the search
by a factor 2.7, making the total area searched equivalent to 1 deg2.
The sample now consists of 56 Type Ia supernovae. The rates we derive
are consistent with our results based on the Cycle 11 observations. In
particular, the small number of supernovae detected at z&gt;1.4 supports
our previous result that there is a drop in the Type Ia supernova rate
at high redshift, suggesting a long time delay between the formation of
the progenitor star and the explosion of the supernova. If described by
a simple one-parameter model, we find a characteristic delay time of 2-3
Gyr. However, a number of recent results based on, e.g., low-redshift
supernova samples and supernova host galaxy properties suggest that the
supernova delay-time distribution is bimodal. In this model a major
fraction of the Type Ia supernova rate are ``prompt'' and follow the
star formation rate, while a smaller fraction of the rate have a long
delay time, making this channel proportional to mass. While our results
are fully consistent with the bimodal model at low redshifts, the low
rate we find at z&gt;1.4 appears to contradict these results. Models
that correct for star formation hidden by dust may explain at least part
of the differences. Here we discuss this possibility together with other
ways to reconcile data and models.

	Abstract = {
We present a new measurement of the volumetric rate of SNe Ia up to a
redshift of 1.7, using the HST GOODS data combined with an additional
HST data set covering the GOODS-North field collected in 2004. We employ
a novel technique that does not require spectroscopic data for
identifying SNe Ia (although spectroscopic measurements of redshifts are
used for over half the sample); instead, we employ a Bayesian approach
using only photometric data to calculate the probability that an object
is an SN Ia. This Bayesian technique can easily be modified to
incorporate improved priors on SN properties, and it is well-suited for
future high-statistics SN searches in which spectroscopic follow-up of
all candidates will be impractical. Here the method is validated on both
ground- and space-based SN data having some spectroscopic follow-up. We
combine our volumetric rate measurements with low-redshift SN data and
fit to a number of possible models for the evolution of the SN Ia rate
as a function of redshift. The data do not distinguish between a flat
rate at redshift &gt;0.5 and a previously proposed model, in which the
Type Ia rate peaks at redshift ~1 due to a significant delay from star
formation to the SN explosion. Except for the highest redshifts, where
the signal-to-noise ratio is generally too low to apply this technique,
this approach yields uncertainties that are smaller than or comparable
to previous work.<p/>

We present SiFTO, a new empirical method for modeling Type Ia supernova
(SN Ia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. We make use of
high-redshift SN data when training the model, allowing us to extend it
bluer than rest-frame U. This increases the utility of our high-redshift
SN observations by allowing us to use more of the available data. We
find that when the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch
prescription, applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an
adequate description. SiFTO therefore uses a generalization of stretch
which applies different stretch factors as a function of both the
wavelength of the observed filter and the stretch in the rest-frame B
band. We compare SiFTO to other published light-curve models by applying
them to the same set of SN photometry, and demonstrate that SiFTO and
SALT2 perform better than the alternatives when judged by the scatter
around the best-fit luminosity distance relationship. We further
demonstrate that when SiFTO and SALT2 are trained on the same data set
the cosmological results agree.<p/>

We present observations of SCP 06F6, an unusual optical transient
discovered during the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey.
The transient brightened over a period of ~100 days, reached a peak
magnitude of ~ 21.0 in both i <SUB>775</SUB> and z <SUB>850</SUB>, and
then declined over a similar timescale. There is no host galaxy or
progenitor star detected at the location of the transient to a 3sigma
upper limit of i <SUB>775</SUB> &gt;= 26.4 and z <SUB>850</SUB> &gt;=
26.1, giving a corresponding lower limit on the flux increase of a
factor of ~ 120. Multiple spectra show five broad absorption bands
between 4100 &#197; and 6500 &#197;, and a mostly featureless
continuum longward of 6500 &#197;. The shape of the light curve is
inconsistent with microlensing. The transient's spectrum, in addition to
being inconsistent with all known supernova types, does not match any
spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. We suggest that the
transient may be one of a new class.<p/>

The observational characteristics of the bright supernova 1979c
discovered in the weak-barred spiral galaxy M100 are discussed. The UBV
light and color curves of SN 1979c were derived from coordinated visual,
photographic and photoelectric photometry carried out from April 15 to
August 4, 1979 and supplementary prediscovery observations and IUE data.
Values of 0.12 + or - 0.03 and 0.08 are estimated for the interstellar
reddening in M100 in B-V and U-B, respectively, while values of 0.06 +
or - 0.02 and 0.04 are adopted for the corresponding reddenings in the
Galaxy. Total color excesses in B-V and U-B of 0.18 + or - 0.04 and 0.12
+ or - 0.03, respectively, are thus obtained, corresponding to total
extinctions in B of 0.75 and v of 0.55 magnitudes. A distance modulus of
M100 of 30.30 + or - 0.15 is derived, which leads to a corrected
absolute B magnitude for SN 1979c of -19.45, making it the brightest
type II supernova on record.

	Abstract = {
We report the discovery by the Robotic Optical Transient Search
Experiment (ROTSE-IIIb) telescope of SN 2008es, an overluminous
supernova (SN) at z = 0.205 with a peak visual magnitude of --22.2.
We present multiwavelength follow-up observations with the Swift
satellite and several ground-based optical telescopes. The ROTSE-IIIb
observations constrain the time of explosion to be 23 &#177; 1
rest-frame days before maximum. The linear decay of the optical light
curve, and the combination of a symmetric, broad Halpha emission line
profile with broad P Cygni Hbeta and Na I lambda5892 profiles, are
properties reminiscent of the bright Type II-L SNe 1979C and 1980K,
although SN 2008es is greater than 10 times more luminous. The host
galaxy is undetected in pre-supernova Sloan Digital Sky Survey images,
and similar to Type II-L SN 2005ap (the most luminous SN ever observed),
the host is most likely a dwarf galaxy with M<SUB>r</SUB> &gt; --
17. Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observations in combination with
Palomar 60 inch photometry measure the spectral energy distribution of
the SN from 200 to 800 nm to be a blackbody that cools from 14000 K at
the time of the optical peak to 6400 K 65 days later. The inferred
blackbody radius is in good agreement with the radius expected for the
expansion speed measured from the broad lines (10000 km
s<SUP>--1</SUP>). The bolometric luminosity at the optical peak is
2.8 &#215; 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>--1</SUP>, with a total
energy radiated over the next 65 days of 5.6 &#215; 10<SUP>50</SUP>
erg. The exceptional luminosity of SN 2008es requires an efficient
conversion of kinetic energy produced from the core-collapse explosion
into radiation. We favor a model in which the large peak luminosity is a
consequence of the core collapse of a progenitor star with a low-mass
extended hydrogen envelope and a stellar wind with a density close to
the upper limit on the mass-loss rate measured from the lack of an X-ray
detection by the Swift X-Ray Telescope.

We present a complete sample of International Ultraviolet Explorer  and
Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet (UV) spectra of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) through 2004. We measure the equivalent width (EW) and
blueshifted velocity of the minimum of the one strong UV feature, Fe II
lambda3250. We also quantify the slope of the near-UV spectra using a
new parameter, the ``UV ratio.'' We find that the velocity of the Fe II
line does not correlate with light-curve shape, while the EW shows
distinct behavior for the slow- and fast-declining objects. Using
precise Cepheid and surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements
of six objects with UV spectra observed near maximum light (a total of
12 spectra), we determine that the UV ratio at maximum light is highly
correlated with SN Ia luminosity. A larger sample of UV spectra is
necessary to determine the validity of these luminosity indicators and
whether they can be combined with light-curve shape to improve measured
SN Ia distances.

We analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of Type Ia
Supernovae (SNe) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise ratio
Keck-I/LRIS-B spectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate
redshift (z=0.5) discovered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We introduce a new method for removing
host galaxy contamination in our spectra, exploiting the comprehensive
photometric coverage of the SNLS SNe and their host galaxies, thereby
providing the first quantitative view of the UV spectral properties of a
large sample of distant SNe Ia. Although the mean SN Ia spectrum has not
evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history, precise
evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparable
sample of high-quality local spectra. The mean UV spectrum of our z~=0.5
SNe Ia and its dispersion is tabulated for use in future applications.
Within the high-redshift sample, we discover significant UV spectral
variations and exclude dust extinction as the primary cause by examining
trends with the optical SN color. Although progenitor metallicity may
drive some of these trends, the variations we see are much larger than
predicted in recent models and do not follow expected patterns. An
interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength of selected
UV features with phase. We also demonstrate systematic differences in
the SN Ia spectral features with SN light curve width in both the UV and
the optical. We show that these intrinsic variations could represent a
statistical limitation in the future use of high-redshift SNe Ia for
precision cosmology. We conclude that further detailed studies are
needed, both locally and at moderate redshift where the rest-frame UV
can be studied precisely, in order that future missions can confidently
be planned to fully exploit SNe Ia as cosmological probes.

Using archival data of low-redshift (z&lt;0.01 Center for Astrophysics
and SUSPECT databases) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and recent
observations of high-redshift (0.16&lt;z&lt;0.64) SNe Ia, we study the
``uniformity'' of the spectroscopic properties of nearby and distant SNe
Ia. We find no difference in the measurements we describe here. In this
paper we base our analysis solely on line-profile morphology, focusing
on measurements of the velocity location of maximum absorption (vabs)
and peak emission (vpeak). Our measurement technique makes it easier to
compare low and high signal-to-noise ratio observations. We also
quantify the associated sources of error, assessing the effect of line
blending with assistance from the parameterized code SYNOW. We find that
the evolution of vabs and vpeak for our sample lines (Ca II
lambda3945, Si II lambda6355, and S II lambdalambda5454, 5640)
is similar for both the low- and high-redshift samples. We find that
vabs for the weak S II lambdalambda5454, 5640 lines and vpeak for S
II lambda5454 can be used to identify fast-declining
[Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)&gt;1.7] SNe Ia, which are also subluminous. In
addition, we give the first direct evidence in two high-z SN Ia spectra
of a double-absorption feature in Ca II lambda3945, an event also
observed, although infrequently, in low-redshift SN Ia spectra (6 out of
22 SNe Ia in our local sample). Moreover, echoing the recent studies of
Dessart &#38; Hillier in the context of Type II supernovae (SNe II), we
see similar P Cygni line profiles in our large sample of SN Ia spectra.
First, the magnitude of the velocity location at maximum profile
absorption may underestimate that at the continuum photosphere, as
observed, for example, in the optically thinner line S II lambda5640.
Second, we report for the first time the unambiguous and systematic
intrinsic blueshift of peak emission of optical P Cygni line profiles in
SN Ia spectra, by as much as 8000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. All the high-z SNe
Ia analyzed in this paper were discovered and followed up by the ESSENCE
collaboration and are now publicly available.<p/>

The spectral properties of Type Ia supernovae in the ultraviolet (UV)
are investigated using the early-time spectra of SN 2001ep and SN 2001eh
obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope. A series of spectral models
is computed with a Monte Carlo spectral synthesis code, and the
dependence of the UV flux on the elemental abundances and the density
gradient in the outer layers of the ejecta is tested. A large fraction
of the UV flux is formed by reverse-fluorescence scattering of photons
from red to blue wavelengths. This process, combined with ionization
shifts due to enhanced line blocking, can lead to a stronger UV flux as
the iron-group abundance in the outer layers is increased, contrary to
previous claims.

We examine the possibility of evolution with redshift in the mean
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV; lambda lsim 4500&#160;&#197;) spectrum of
Type&#160;Ia Supernovae (SNe&#160;Ia) sampling the redshift range 0 &lt;
z &lt; 1.3. We find new evidence for a decrease with redshift in the
strength of intermediate-mass element (IME) features, particularly Si II
and to a lesser extent Ca II "H&#38;K" and Mg II blends, indicating
lower IME abundances in the higher redshift SNe. A larger fraction of
luminous, wider light-curve width (higher "stretch") SNe&#160;Ia are
expected at higher redshift than locally, so we compare our observed
spectral evolution with that predicted by a redshift-evolving stretch
distribution coupled with a stretch-dependent SN&#160;Ia spectrum. We
show that the sense of the spectral evolution can be reproduced by this
simple model, though the highest redshift events seem additionally
deficient in Si and Ca. We also examine the mean SN&#160;Ia UV-optical
colors as a function of redshift, thought to be sensitive to variations
in progenitor composition. We find that the expected stretch variations
are sufficient to explain the differences, although improved data at z ~
0 will enable more precise tests. Thus, to the extent possible with the
available data sets, our results support the continued use of
SNe&#160;Ia as standardized candles.

	Abstract = {
We use recent observations of the evolution of the Type Ia supernova (SN
Ia) rate with redshift, the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the colours
of the parent galaxies, and the enhancement of the SN Ia rate in
radio-loud early-type galaxies to derive on robust empirical grounds,
the delay time distribution (DTD) between the formation of the
progenitor star and its explosion as an SN. Our analysis finds: (i)
delay times as long as 3-4 Gyr, derived from observations of SNe Ia at
high redshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the SN Ia rate on the
colours and on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed
in the local Universe; (ii) the comparison between observed SN rates and
a grid of theoretical `single-population' DTDs shows that only a few of
them are possibly consistent with observations. The most successful
models are all predicting a peak of SN explosions soon after star
formation and an extended tail in the DTD, and can reproduce the data
but only at a modest statistical confidence level; (iii) present data
are best matched by a bimodal DTD, in which about 50 per cent of SNe Ia
(dubbed `prompt' SNe Ia) explode soon after their stellar birth, in a
time of the order of 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr, while the remaining 50 per cent
(`tardy' SNe Ia) have a much wider distribution, well described by an
exponential function with a decay time of about 3 Gyr.<p/>

The presence in the DTD of both a strong peak at early times and a
prolonged exponential tail, coupled with the well-established bimodal
distribution of the decay rate (Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>) and the
systematic difference observed in the expansion velocities of the ejecta
of SNe Ia in ellipticals and spirals, suggests the existence of two
classes of progenitors. We discuss the cosmological implications of this
result and make simple predictions, which are testable with future
instrumentation.

@article{Greggio:2005,
	Abstract = {
The aim of this paper is to provide a handy tool to compute the impact
of type Ia SN (SNIa) events on the evolution of stellar systems. An
effective formalism to couple the rate of SNIa explosions from a single
burst of star formation and the star formation history is presented,
which rests upon the definition of the realization probability of the
SNIa event (A<SUB>Ia</SUB>) and the distribution function of the delay
times (f<SUB>Ia</SUB>(tau)). It is shown that the current SNIa rate in
late type galaxies constrains A<SUB>Ia</SUB> to be on the order of
10<SUP>-3</SUP> (i.e. 1 SNIa every 1000 M<SUB>o</SUB> of gas turned
into stars), while the comparison of the current rates in early and late
type galaxies implies that f<SUB>Ia</SUB> ought to be more populated at
short delays. The paper presents analytical formulations for the
description of the f<SUB>Ia</SUB> function for the most popular models
of SNIa progenitors, namely Single Degenerates (Chandrasekhar and
Sub-Chandrasekhar exploders), and Double Degenerates. These formulations
follow entirely from general considerations on the evolutionary behavior
of stars in binary systems, modulo a schematization of the outcome of
the phases of mass exchange, and compare well with the results of
population synthesis codes, for the same choice of parameters. The
derivation presented here offers an immediate astrophysical
interpretation of the shape of the f<SUB>Ia</SUB> functions, and have a
built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative
candidates. The important parameters appear to be the minimum and
maximum masses of the components of the binary systems giving rise to a
SNIa explosions, the distribution of the primary mass and of the mass
ratios in these systems, the distribution of the separations of the DD
systems at their birth. The various models for the progenitors
correspond to markedly different impact on the large scales;
correspondingly, the model for the progenitor can be constrained by
examining the relevant observations. Among these, the paper concentrates
on the trend of the current SNIa rate with parent galaxy type. The
recent data by Mannucci et al. (2005, A&#38;A, 433, 807) favor the DD
channel over the SD one, which tends to predict a too steep distribution
function of the delay times. The SD scenario can be reconciled with the
observations only if the distribution of the mass ratios in the
primordial binaries is flat and the accretion efficiency onto the WD is
close to 100%. The various models are characterized by different
timescales for the Fe release from a single burst stellar population. In
particular the delay time within which half of the SNIa events from such
a population have occurred, ranges between 0.3 and 3 Gyr, for a wide
variety of hypothesis on the progenitors.

Using an extensive compilation of the literature supernova rate data we
study to which extent its evolution constrains the star formation
history, the distribution of the type Ia supernova (SNIa)
progenitor's lifetime, the mass range of Core-Collapse Supernova
(CCSN) progenitors, and the evolution of the iron density in the field.
We find that the diagnostic power of the cosmic SNIa rate on their
progenitor model is relatively weak. More promising is the use of the
evolution of the SNIa rate in galaxy clusters. We find that the CCSN
rate is compatible with a Salpeter IMF, with a minimum mass for their
progenitors &gsim;10M<SUB>o</SUB>. We estimate the evolution in the
field of the iron density released by SNe and find that in the local
universe the iron abundance should be &tilde;0.1 solar. We discuss the
difference between this value and the iron abundance in clusters.

We present the results of spectroscopic observations from the ESSENCE
high-redshift supernova (SN) survey during its first four years of
operation. This sample includes spectra of all SNe Ia whose light curves
were presented by Miknaitis et al. and used in the cosmological analyses
of Davis et al. and Wood-Vasey et al. The sample represents 273 hr of
spectroscopic observations with 6.5-10 m class telescopes of objects
detected and selected for spectroscopy by the ESSENCE team. We present
184 spectra of 156 objects. Combining this sample with that of Matheson
et al., we have a total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. From this,
we are able to spectroscopically classify 118 Type Ia SNe. As the survey
has matured, the efficiency of classifying SNe Ia has remained constant
while we have observed both higher-redshift SNe Ia and SNe Ia farther
from maximum brightness. Examining the subsample of SNe Ia with
host-galaxy redshifts shows that redshifts derived from only the SN Ia
spectra are consistent with redshifts found from host-galaxy spectra.
Moreover, the phases derived from only the SN Ia spectra are consistent
with those derived from light-curve fits. By comparing our spectra to
local templates, we find that the rate of objects similar to the
overluminous SN 1991T and the underluminous SN 1991bg in our sample are
consistent with that of the local sample. We do note, however, that we
detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to SN
1991bg. Although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate
we expect based on the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that SN
1991bg-like SNe Ia are less prevalent at high redshift.

We present a large-scale effort of creating composite spectra of
high-redshift SNe Ia and comparing them to low-redshift counterparts in
an attempt to understand possible cosmic evolution of SNe Ia, which has
major implications for studies of dark energy. Through the ESSENCE
project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88 high-redshift SNe Ia with
excellent light-curve information. In addition, we have obtained 397
spectra of low-redshift SNe Ia through a multiple-decade effort at the
Lick and Keck Observatories, and we have used 45 UV spectra obtained by
HST and IUE. The low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when
comparing to the ESSENCE spectra. In all instances, the ESSENCE and Lick
composite spectra appear very similar. The addition of galaxy light to
the Lick composite spectra allows an excellent match of the overall SED
with the ESSENCE composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift
SNe are more contaminated with host galaxy light than their low-redshift
counterparts. This is caused by observing objects at all redshifts with
similar angular slit widths, which corresponds to different projected
physical distances. After correcting for the galaxy light contamination,
a few marginally significant differences in the spectra remain. We have
estimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates
for K-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. The variance in the composite spectra
gives an estimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum
light SN spectra of ~3% relative flux in the optical and growing toward
the UV. The difference between the maximum light low- and high-redshift
spectra constrains the evolution of SN spectral features between our
samples to be &lt;10% relative flux in the rest-frame optical.
Currently, galaxy contamination and the small samples of rest-frame UV
spectra at low and high redshifts are the limiting factors for future
studies.

We present distance measurements to 71 high redshift type Ia supernovae
discovered during the first year of the 5-year Supernova Legacy Survey
(SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-color light-curves
measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four
one-square degree fields in four bands, as part of the CFHT Legacy
Survey (CFHTLS). Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini
and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to
measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble
diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements involving at
least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use of
the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this
first year SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results: Omega_M=
0.263 &#177; 0.042 (stat) &#177; 0.032 (sys) for a flat LambdaCDM
model; and w = -1.023 &#177; 0.090 (stat) &#177; 0.054 (sys) for a
flat cosmology with constant equation of state w when combined with the
constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of
baryon acoustic oscillations.

Observed data are often contaminated by undiscovered interlopers,
leading to biased parameter estimation. Here we present BEAMS (Bayesian
estimation applied to multiple species) which significantly improves on
the standard maximum likelihood approach in the case where the
probability for each data point being ``pure'' is known. We
discuss the application of BEAMS to future type-Ia supernovae (SNIa)
surveys, such as LSST, which are projected to deliver over a million
supernovae light curves without spectra. The multiband light curves for
each candidate will provide a probability of being Ia (pure) but the
full sample will be significantly contaminated with other types of
supernovae and transients. Given a sample of N supernovae with mean
probability, <P>, of being Ia, BEAMS delivers parameter
constraints equal to N<P> spectroscopically confirmed SNIa. In
addition BEAMS can be simultaneously used to tease apart different
families of data and to recover properties of the underlying
distributions of those families (e.g. the type-Ibc and II
distributions). Hence BEAMS provides a unified classification and
parameter estimation methodology which may be useful in a diverse range
of problems such as photometric redshift estimation or, indeed, any
parameter estimation problem where contamination is an issue.

The Asiago Supernova Catalog is used to carry out a comparative study of
supernova absolute magnitude distributions. An overview of the absolute
magnitudes of the supernovae in the current observational sample is
presented, and the evidence for subluminous and overluminous events is
examined. The fraction of supernovae that are subluminous
(M<SUB>B</SUB>&gt;-15) appears to be higher (perhaps much higher) than
1/5 but it remains very uncertain. The fraction that are overluminous
(M<SUB>B</SUB>&gt;-20) is lower (probably much lower) than 0.01. The
absolute magnitude distributions for each supernova type, restricted to
events within 1 Gpc, are compared. Although these distributions are
affected by observational bias in favor of the more luminous events,
they are useful for comparative studies. We find mean absolute blue
magnitudes (for H<SUB>0</SUB>=60) of -19.46 for normal Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), -18.04 for SNe Ibc, -17.61 and -20.26 for normal
and bright SNe Ibc considered separately, -18.03 for SNe II-L, -17.56
and -19.27 for normal and bright SNe II-L considered separately, -17.00
for SNe II-P, and -19.15 for SNe IIn.

	Abstract = {
We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new data
set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis procedures
to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This ``Union''
compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection
cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova
Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as the
recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A single, consistent, and blind analysis
procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples, and a new
procedure is implemented that consistently weights the heterogeneous
data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest results from this
Union compilation and discuss the cosmological constraints from this new
compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements
(CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain from supernovae on the dark
energy density is
Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=0.713<SUP>+0.027</SUP><SUB>-0.029</SUB>(stat)<SUP>+0.036</SUP><SUB>-0.039</SUB>(sys),
for a flat, LambdaCDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state
parameter, w, the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give
w=-0.969<SUP>+0.059</SUP><SUB>-0.063</SUB>(stat)<SUP>+0.063</SUP><SUB>-0.066</SUB>(sys).
While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain
only relatively weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In
particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at
z&gt;1. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these
resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.

@article{Lien:2009,
	Abstract = {
Large synoptic (repeated scan) imaging sky surveys are poised to observe
enormous numbers of core-collapse supernovae. We quantify the discovery
potential of such surveys, and apply our results to upcoming projects,
including DES, Pan-STARRS, and LSST. The latter two will harvest
core-collapse supernovae in numbers orders of magnitude greater than
have ever been observed to date. These surveys will map out the cosmic
core-collapse supernova redshift distribution via direct counting, with
very small statistical uncertainties out to a redshift depth which is a
strong function of the survey limiting magnitude. This supernova
redshift history encodes rich information about cosmology, star
formation, and supernova astrophysics and phenomenology; the large
statistics of the supernova sample will be crucial to disentangle
possible degeneracies among these issues. For example, the cosmic
supernova rate can be measured to high precision out to z ~ 0.5 for all
core-collapse types, and out to redshift z ~ 1 for Type IIn events if
their intrinsic properties remain the same as those measured locally. A
precision knowledge of the cosmic supernova rate would remove the
cosmological uncertainties in the study of the wealth of observable
properties of the cosmic supernova populations and their evolution with
environment and redshift. Because of the tight link between supernovae
and star formation, synoptic sky surveys will also provide precision
measurements of the normalization and z lap 1 history of cosmic
star-formation rate in a manner independent of and complementary to than
current data based on UV and other proxies for massive star formation.
Furthermore, Type II supernovae can serve as distance indicators and
would independently cross-check Type Ia distances measured in the same
surveys. Arguably the largest and least-controlled uncertainty in all of
these efforts comes from the poorly-understood evolution of dust
obscuration of supernovae in their host galaxies; we outline a strategy
to determine empirically the obscuration properties by leveraging the
large supernova samples over a broad range of redshift. We conclude with
recommendations on how best to use (and to tailor) these galaxy surveys
to fully extract unique new probes on the physics, astrophysics, and
cosmology of core-collapse explosions.

	Abstract = {
We explore the idea that the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate consists of
two components: a prompt piece that is proportional to the star
formation rate (SFR), and an extended piece that is proportional to the
total stellar mass. We fit the parameters of this model to the local
observations by Mannucci and collaborators and then study its impact on
three important problems. On cosmic scales, the model reproduces the
observed SN Ia rate density below z=1 and predicts that it will track
the measured SFR density at higher redshift, reaching a value of
(1-3.5)&#215;10<SUP>-4</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> at z=2.
In galaxy clusters, a large prompt contribution helps explain the Fe
content of the intracluster medium. Within the Galaxy, the model
reproduces the observed stellar [O/Fe] abundance ratios if we allow a
short (~0.7 Gyr) delay in the prompt component. Ongoing medium-z SN
surveys will yield more accurate parameters for our model.

We compute the rate of supernovae (SNe) of different types along the
Hubble sequence normalized to the near-infrared luminosity and to the
stellar mass of the parent galaxies. This is made possible by the new
complete catalog of near-infrared galaxy magnitudes obtained by 2MASS.
We find that the rates of all SN types, including Ia, Ib/c and II, show
a sharp dependence on both the morphology and the (B-K) colors of the
parent galaxies and, therefore, on the star formation activity. In
particular we find, with a high statistical significance, that the type
Ia rate in late type galaxies is a factor ~20 higher than in E/S0.
Similarly, the type Ia rate in the galaxies bluer than B-K=2.6 is about
a factor of 30 larger than in galaxies with B-K&gt;4.1. These findings
can be explained by assuming that a significant fraction of Ia events in
late spirals/irregulars originates in a relatively young stellar
component.

We present an algorithm to identify the type of an SN spectrum and to
determine its redshift and age. This algorithm, based on the correlation
techniques of Tonry &#38; Davis, is implemented in the Supernova
Identification (SNID) code. It is used by members of ongoing
high-redshift SN searches to distinguish between Type Ia and Ib/c SNe
and to identify ``peculiar'' SNe Ia. We develop a diagnostic to quantify
the quality of a correlation between the input and template spectra,
which enables a formal evaluation of the associated redshift error.
Furthermore, by comparing the correlation redshifts obtained using SNID
with those determined from narrow lines in the SN host galaxy spectrum,
we show that accurate redshifts (with a typical error
sigma<SUB>z</SUB>&lt;~0.01) can be determined for SNe Ia without a
spectrum of the host galaxy. Last, the age of an input spectrum is
determined with a typical accuracy sigma<SUB>t</SUB>&lt;~3 days, shown
here by using high-redshift SNe Ia with well-sampled light curves. The
success of the correlation technique confirms the similarity of some SNe
Ia at low and high redshifts. The SNID code, which will be made
available to the community, can also be used for comparative studies of
SN spectra, as well as comparisons between data and models.

Aims.We present <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass estimates for seventeen
well-observed type Ia supernovae determined by two independent
methods.<BR /> Methods: .Estimates of the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass for each
type Ia supernova are determined from (1) modeling of the late-time
nebular spectrum and (2) through the combination of the peak bolometric
luminosity with Arnett's rule. The attractiveness of this approach is
that the comparison of estimated <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses circumvents
errors associated with the uncertainty in the adopted values of
reddening and distance. <BR /> Results: .We demonstrate that these two
methods provide consistent estimates of the amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni
synthesized. We also find a strong correlation between the derived
<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass and the absolute B-band magnitude
(M<SUB>B</SUB>).<BR /> Conclusions: .Spectral synthesis can be used as a
diagnostic to study the explosion mechanism. By obtaining more nebular
spectra the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-M<SUB>B</SUB> correlation can be calibrated,
and be used to investigate any potential systematic effects this
relationship may have upon the determination of cosmological parameters,
and provide a new manner to estimate extra-galactic distances of nearby

Optical and near-infrared light curves of the Type IIn supernova SN
1999el in NGC 6951 are presented. A period of 220 days (416 days in the
near-infrared) is covered from the first observation obtained a few days
before maximum light. Spectroscopic observations are also discussed.
Using as a distance calibrator the Type Ia SN 2000E, which occurred some
months later in the same galaxy, and fitting a blackbody law to the
photometric data, we obtain a maximum bolometric luminosity for SN
1999el of ~10<SUP>44</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. In general, the
photometric properties of SN 1999el are very similar to those of SN
1998S, a bright and well-studied Type IIn supernova, showing a fast
decline in all observed bands similar to those of Type II-L supernovae.
The differences with SN 1998S are analyzed and ascribed to the
differences in a preexisting circumstellar envelope in which dust was
already present at the moment of the SN outburst. We infer that light
echoes may play a possibly significant role in affecting the observed
properties of the light curves, although improved theoretical models are
needed to account for the data. We conclude that mass loss in the
progenitor RG stars is episodic and occurs in an asymmetric way. This
implies that collapsing massive stars appear as normal Type II
supernovae if this occurs far from major mass-loss episodes, whereas
they appear as Type IIn supernovae if a large mass-loss episode is in
progress. Based on observations collected with the AZT-24 telescope
(Campo Imperatore, Italy), the 1.8 m telescope of the Osservatorio
Astronomico di Padova (Asiago, Italy), the Teramo-Normale Telescope
operated by the Osservatorio Astronomico di Collurania-Teramo (Teramo,

@article{Filippenko:1997,
	Abstract = {
The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of
supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying
supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of
hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and
spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three
subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si
II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The
late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission
lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe
Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively
unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which
result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a
rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric
and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably
result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their
hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically
related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have
only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to
resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric
subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor

distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P
Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These
objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the

Ten years ago, the discovery that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating put in place the last major building block of the present
cosmological model, in which the universe is composed of 4% baryons, 20%
dark matter, and 76% dark energy. At the same time, it posed one of the
most profound mysteries in all of science, with deep connections to both
astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from
the repulsive gravity of dark energy---for example, the quantum
energy of the vacuum---or it may signal that general relativity (GR)
breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. We review the
present observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has
revealed about dark energy, discuss the various theoretical ideas that
have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key
observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in the coming
years.

@article{Voit:2005,
	Abstract = {
The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure
formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly
drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures.
Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest
objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own
gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively
recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of
cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we
can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have
undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium.
Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine
the amount of structure in the universe on scales of  10<SUP>14</SUP>  
10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>o</SUB> , and comparisons of the present-day
cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times
can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing
important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are
essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous
matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and
active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of
clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore
contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with
galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are
converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes
on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding
of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of
clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster
observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray
observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of
cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background.

The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide
stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter
Lambda&#160;cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use
them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity,
adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations,
gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of
dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and
neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect
no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and
the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined
with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are:
Omega<SUB> b </SUB> h <SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02267<SUP>+0.00058</SUP>

\Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002
Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. From these, we derive sigma<SUB>8</SUB> = 0.812
&#177; 0.026, H <SUB>0</SUB> = 70.5 &#177; 1.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>

&#177; 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find
the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.22(95%CL), and that
n<SUB>s</SUB> &gt; 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are
included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce
significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation
models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain
tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark
energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: --0.14 &lt; 1 + w
&lt; 0.12(95%CL) and --0.0179 &lt; Omega<SUB> k </SUB> &lt;
0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a
variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a
time-dependent w with a present value constrained as --0.33 &lt; 1
+ w <SUB>0</SUB> &lt; 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter
fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and
2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The
power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating
interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B.
The polarization angle could not be rotated more than --5fdg9 &lt;
Deltaalpha &lt; 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the
present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos
of &sum;m <SUB>nu</SUB> &lt; 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the
uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The
number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of
the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N
<SUB>eff</SUB> = 4.4 &#177; 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard
value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated
primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are --9 &lt; f
<SUP>local</SUP> <SUB>NL</SUB> &lt; 111 (95% CL) and --151 &lt; f
<SUP>equil</SUP> <SUB>NL</SUB> &lt; 253 (95% CL) for the local and
equilateral models, respectively.<p/>

A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density,
Omega<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>, baryon density,
Omega<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>, Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>,
amplitude of fluctuations, sigma<SUB>8</SUB>, optical depth, tau,
and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, n<SUB>s</SUB>) fits
not only the 3 year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also
small-scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure
observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using
WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the
power-law flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model are
(Omega<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>,Omega<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>,h,n<SUB>s</SUB>,tau,sigma<SUB>8</SUB>)=(0.1277<SUP>+0.0080</SUP><SUB>-0.0079</SUB>,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732<SUP>+0.031</SUP><SUB>-0.032</SUB>,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761<SUP>+0.049</SUP><SUB>-0.048</SUB>).
The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this
six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial
fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data
alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is
significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum (n<SUB>s</SUB>=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves
the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For
power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, r<SUB>0.002</SUB>&lt;0.65 (95% CL) and the
combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey
implies r<SUB>0.002</SUB>&lt;0.30 (95% CL). Models that suppress
large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale
cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and
small-scale CMB data than the power-law LambdaCDM model; however, the
improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only
Deltachi<SUP>2</SUP>=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a
running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity
waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova
Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the
equation of state of the dark energy,
w=-0.967<SUP>+0.073</SUP><SUB>-0.072</SUB>. If we assume w=-1, then the
deviations from the critical density, Omega<SUB>K</SUB>, are small:
the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies
Omega<SUB>k</SUB>=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data
plus the HST Key Project constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> implies
Omega<SUB>k</SUB>=-0.014+/-0.017 and
Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the
prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale
structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on
the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe,
the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint
on the sum of the neutrino masses, Sigmam<SUB>nu</SUB>&lt;0.66 eV
(95%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary
theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the
CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a
new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the
fluctuations.

	Abstract = {
The High-z Supernova Search Team has discovered and observed eight new
supernovae in the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. These independent
observations, analyzed by similar but distinct methods, confirm the
results of Riess and Perlmutter and coworkers that supernova luminosity
distances imply an accelerating universe. More importantly, they extend
the redshift range of consistently observed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
to z~1, where the signature of cosmological effects has the opposite
sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently, these
measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation of the
importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful qualitative
test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration. We find a rate
for SN Ia of
(1.4+/-0.5)&#215;10<SUP>-4</SUP>h<SUP>3</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>
at a mean redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for
230 SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological
quantities: if the equation of state parameter of the dark energy is
w=-1, then H<SUB>0</SUB>t<SUB>0</SUB>=0.96+/-0.04, and
Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>-1.4Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.35+/-0.14. Including
the constraint of a flat universe, we find
Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale
structure measurements. Adopting a prior based on the Two Degree Field
(2dF) Redshift Survey constraint on Omega<SUB>M</SUB> and assuming a
flat universe, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark
energy lies in the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. If we
further assume that w&gt;-1, we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence.
These constraints are similar in precision and in value to recent
results reported using the WMAP satellite, also in combination with the
2dF Redshift Survey.<p/>

@article{Riess:1998,
	Abstract = {
We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.62. The
luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that
employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape.
Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and
recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift
supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble
constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant
(i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration
parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The
distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther
than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a
cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia
subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding
models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda &gt; 0)
and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 &lt; 0). With no
prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M &gt;= 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0
&lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with
Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the
two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda &gt; 0 at 7
sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different
fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M =
1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for
the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the
universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in
the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and
metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local
perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample
contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the
data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 &gt;= 0.

@article{Perlmutter:1999,
	Abstract = {
We report measurements of the mass density, Omega_M, and
cosmological-constant energy density, Omega_Lambda, of the universe
based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the
Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these
supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with
a set of supernovae from the Cal&#225;n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at
redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters.
All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve
width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability
distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the
relation 0.8Omega_M-0.6Omega_Lambda~-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest
(Omega_M&lt;~1.5). For a flat (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1) cosmology we find
Omega^flat_M=0.28^+0.09_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical) ^+0.05_-0.04
(identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a
Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An
open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data
indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a
confidence of P(Lambda&gt;0)=99%, including the identified systematic
uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble
time is t^flat_0=14.9^+1.4_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The
size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests
to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no
significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or
Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal&#225;n/Tololo sample and
our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are
outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change
the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a
width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak
magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical
alternatives to a cosmological constant.

Photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates are playing an increasingly
important role in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Crucial to many
photo-z applications is the accurate quantification of photometric
redshift errors and their distributions, including identification of
likely catastrophic failures in photo-z estimates. We consider several
methods of estimating photo-z errors, and propose new training-set based
error estimators based on spectroscopic training set data. Using data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and simulations of the Dark Energy
Survey as examples, we show that this method provides a robust,
relatively unbiased estimate of photo-z errors. We show that culling
objects with large, accurately estimated photo-z errors from a sample
can reduce the incidence of catastrophic photo-z failures.

Traditional photometric redshift methods use only color information
about the objects in question to estimate their redshifts. This paper
introduces a new method utilizing colors, luminosity, surface
brightness, and radial light profile to measure the redshifts of
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We take a statistical
approach: distributions of galaxies from the SDSS large-scale structure
(LSS; spectroscopic) sample are constructed at a range of redshifts, and
target galaxies are compared to these distributions. An adaptive mesh is
implemented to increase the percentage of the parameter space populated
by the LSS galaxies. We test the method on a subset of galaxies from the
LSS sample, yielding rms Deltaz of 0.025 for red galaxies and 0.030
for blue galaxies (all with z&lt;0.25). Possible future improvements to
this promising technique are described, as is our ongoing work to extend
the method to galaxies at higher redshift.

@article{Benitez:2000,
	Abstract = {
Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of
observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered
by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability
of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the
``training-set'' approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the
problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of
these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian
marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as
the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type
fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are
often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking
or insufficient-for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the
observations-the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated
using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being
obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the
accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that
has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the
selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric
redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of
individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the
statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the
Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with
a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There
is excellent agreement between the ~130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N)
spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms
error of Deltaz~0.06(1+z<SUB>spec</SUB>) up to z&lt;6 and no outliers
nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results
have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above
value of Deltaz should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for
any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts
in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters;
the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those
obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.

We have coordinated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry with
ground-based discovery for three supernovae: Type Ia supernovae near
z~0.5 (SN 1997ce, SN 1997cj) and a third event at z=0.97 (SN 1997ck).
The superb spatial resolution of HST separates each supernova from its
host galaxy and leads to good precision in the light curves. We use
these light curves and relations between luminosity, light-curve shape,
and color calibrated from low-z samples to derive relative luminosity
distances that are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20% at z=1 . When the
HST sample is combined with the distance to SN 1995K ( z=0.48 ),
analyzed by the same precepts, we find that matter alone is insufficient
to produce a flat universe. Specifically, for Omega <SUB>m</SUB>+ Omega
_{ Lamda }=1 , Omega <SUB>m</SUB> is less than 1 with more than 95%
confidence, and our best estimate of Omega m is -0.1+/-0.5 if Omega _{
Lamda }=0 . Although this result is based on a very small sample whose
systematics remain to be explored, it demonstrates the power of HST
measurements for high-redshift supernovae.

depends on the magnitude limit and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), 
wavelength coverage, and the number of filters and their shapes and 
observed galaxy type. We use simulated galaxy catalogs constructed to 
reproduce observed galaxy luminosity functions from the Great 
Observatories Origins Deep Survey and derive photometric redshifts using 
a template fitting method. By using a catalog that resembles real data, 
we can estimate the expected number density of galaxies for which 
photometric redshifts can be derived. We find that the accuracy of the 
photometric redshifts is strongly dependent on the S/N (i.e., S/N {\gt} 
10 is needed for accurate photometric redshifts). The accuracy of the 
photometric redshifts is also dependent on galaxy type, with smaller 
scatter for earlier-type galaxies. Comparing results using different 
filter sets, we find that including the U-band and near-IR bands is 
important for decreasing the fraction of outliers, i.e., ''catastrophic 
failures.'' Using broad overlapping filters with resolution \~{}4 gives 
better photometric redshifts compared to narrower filters (resolution 
gsim5) with the same integration time. We find that filters with square 
response curves result in a slightly higher scatter, mainly due to a 
higher fraction of outliers at faint magnitudes. We also compare a 
9-filter set to a 17-filter set, where we assume that the available 
exposure time per filter in the latter set is half that of the first 
set. We find that the 9-filter set gives more accurate redshifts for a 
larger number of objects and reaches higher redshift, while the 
17-filter set gives better results at bright magnitudes.

	Abstract = {
We have discovered 21 new Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) and have used them to trace the history of cosmic
expansion over the last 10 billion yr. These objects, which include 13
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia at z&gt;=1, were discovered during 14
epochs of reimaging of the GOODS fields North and South over 2 yr with
the Advanced Camera for Surveys on  HST. Together with a recalibration
of our previous HST-discovered SNe Ia, the full sample of 23 SNe Ia at
z&gt;=1 provides the highest redshift sample known. Combining these data
with previous SN Ia data sets, we measured H(z) at discrete,
uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of H(z&gt;1) from 50% to
under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk-the transition
from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The unique
leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful
constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z&gt;=1.
The result remains consistent with a cosmological constant [w(z)=-1] and
rules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz&gt;&gt;1). The defining
property of dark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at
z&gt;1, in the epoch preceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our
primary fit. Moreover, the z&gt;1 sample-averaged spectral energy
distribution is consistent with that of the typical SN Ia over the last
10 Gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution of the properties of SNe
Ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.<p/>

We present a self-consistent comparison of the rise times for low- and
high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. Following previous studies, the early
light curve is modeled using a t<SUP>2</SUP> law, which is then mated
with a modified Leibundgut template light curve. The best-fit
t<SUP>2</SUP> law is determined for ensemble samples of low- and
high-redshift supernovae by fitting simultaneously for all light-curve
parameters for all supernovae in each sample. Our method fully accounts
for the nonnegligible covariance among the light-curve fitting
parameters, which previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to recent
results by Riess et al., we find fair to good agreement between the rise
times of the low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. The uncertainty
in the rise time of the high-redshift Type Ia supernovae is presently
quite large (roughly +/-1.2 days statistical), making any search for
evidence of evolution based on a comparison of rise times premature.
Furthermore, systematic effects on rise-time determinations from the
high-redshift observations, due to the form of the late-time light curve
and the manner in which the light curves of these supernovae were
sampled, can bias the high-redshift rise-time determinations by up to
<SUP>+3.6</SUP><SUB>-1.9</SUB> days under extreme situations. The peak
brightnesses-used for cosmology-do not suffer any significant bias, nor
any significant increase in uncertainty.

We study the radial distribution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in
morphologically selected early-type host galaxies from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) and discuss its implications for the progenitor
systems of SNe Ia. While new observations of early-type galaxies suggest
that they contain small fractions of young stellar populations, they are
also the most likely hosts for long time-delay SNe Ia. We find that
there is no statistically significant difference between the radial
distribution of SNe Ia and the light profile of their early-type host
galaxies, which are dominated by old, metal-rich stellar populations.
This confirms the commonly accepted idea that some SN Ia progenitors
have time delays of the order of several Gyr.

@article{Howell:2009,
	Abstract = {Timmes et al. found that metallicity variations could theoretically account for a 25% variation in the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter in observed SN Ia luminosities. Higher-metallicity progenitors are more neutron rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. We develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield in SNe Ia and use it to test the theory with data from the Supernova Legacy Survey. We find that the average <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield does drop in SNe Ia from high-metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%-10% of the dispersion in SN Ia <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, and thus luminosity. This is because the effect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we find that SN hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solar metallicities. We also show that allowing for changes in O/Fe with the metallicity [Fe/H] does not have a major effect on the theoretical prediction of Timmes et al., so long as one is using the O/H as the independent variable. Age may have a greater effect than metallicity---we find that the luminosity-weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with <SUP>56</SUP>Ni yield, and thus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. This is hard to understand if most SNe Ia explode when the primaries reach the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we test the findings of Gallagher et al. that the residuals of SNe Ia from the Hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxy metallicity, and we find no such correlation.},

	Abstract = {Repeated imaging observations have been made of NGC 3982 with the Hubble Space Telescope between 2000 March and May, over an interval of 53 days. Images were obtained on 12 epochs in the F555W band and on five epochs in the F814W band. The galaxy hosted the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 1998aq. A total of 26 Cepheid candidates were identified, with periods ranging from 10 to 45 days, using photometry with the DoPHOT program. The dereddened distance to NGC 3982 is estimated from these data using various criteria to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and reliability: the values lie between 31.71 and 31.82, with uncertainties in the mean of typically +/-0.14 mag for each case. A parallel analysis using photometry with HSTphot discovered 13 variables, yielding a distance modulus of 31.85+/-0.16. The final adopted modulus is (M-m)<SUB>0</SUB>=31.72+/-0.14 (22+/-1.5 Mpc). Photometry of SN 1998aq that is available in the literature is used in combination with the derived distance to NGC 3982 to obtain the peak absolute magnitude of this supernova. The lower limit (no extinction within the host galaxy) for M<SUB>V</SUB> is -19.47+/-0.15 mag. Corrections for decline rate and intrinsic color to carry these to the reduced system of Parodi and collaborators have been performed. The derived luminosities at hand are fully consistent with the mean of the eight normal SNe Ia previously calibrated with Cepheids. Together they yield H<SUB>0</SUB>~60+/-2(internal) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> based on an assumed LMC distance modulus of 18.50. We point out that correcting some of the systematic errors and including uncertainty estimates due to them leads to H<SUB>0</SUB>=58.7+/-6.3(internal) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>.},

	Abstract = {Optical spectra of SN 1991T obtained approximately one week before B maximum showed no evidence of the Si, Ca, and S absorption lines which normally dominate the spectra of type Ia supernovae at early phases. Nevertheless, within two weeks after maximum, the spectrum of SN 1991T had evolved to resemble closely that of other type Ia events. These observations suggest that the abundances of Si, Ca, and S in the outer ejecta of SN 1991T were unusually low. The B and V light curves of SN 1991T resembled those of other type Ia supernovae, but the slope of the initial decline following maximum was less steep than normal in both colors. In spite of these spectroscopic and photometric peculiarities, the absolute magnitude of SN 1991T at B maximum was apparently similar to that of a typical type Ia event. Thus, although the data suggest that SN 1991T was a type Ia supernova with peculiar surface abundances, in most other ways it seems to have been a completely normal type Ia explosion.},

@article{Leibundgut:1991,
	Abstract = {Spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN 1990N were obtained at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths, beginning 14 days before maximum light. The early observations reveal important differences from spectra of SN Ia's around maximum light. Photometry and spectroscopy obtained after maximum show that SN 1990N is a typical SN Ia and that most of the observed differences are due to the early epoch of the observations. The most significant characteristics are (1) the high velocities of Ca and Si up to 22,000 km/s; (2) the presence of Co and Fe 2 weeks before maximum; and (3) the more rapid increase in the UV flux compared to the optical. The most popular models for white dwarf deflagration that have provided the standard interpretation for SN Ia's at maximum light do not reproduce the high velocities of Ca II and Si II lines observed in SN 1990N.},

	Abstract = {UBVRIJ photometry and optical spectra of the type Ia SN 1996X obtained at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) during a 1-yr-long observational campaign are presented, and supplemented by late-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry. Spectroscopically, SN 1996X appears to be a `normal' SN Ia. The apparent magnitude at maximum was B=13.24+/-0.02, and the colour B-V=0.00+/-0.03. The luminosity decline rate, Deltam<SUB>B</SUB>(15)=1.31+/-0.08, is close to average for a SN Ia. The best estimate of the galactic extinction is A<SUB>B</SUB>=0.30+/-0.05, and there is evidence that reddening within the parent galaxy is negligible. Detailed comparison of the light and colour curves of various `normal' SNe Ia shows that the assumption that multicolour light curves can be described simply as a one-parameter family is not perfect. Together with problems in the calibration of the templates, this may explain the discrepancies in the distance modulus derived adopting different calibrations of the absolute magnitude versus light-curve shape relations. Indeed, we found that M<SUB>B</SUB> ranges from -19.08 to -19.48 and mu ranges from 32.02 to 32.48 depending on the method used. Computations of model light-curve and synthetic spectra for both early and late times confirm that 1996X is a normal type Ia SN and that a satisfactory fit can be obtained using a W7 progenitor structure only if we adopt the short distance. A larger distance would imply too large a Ni mass for this fainter than average SN Ia.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of an {$[$}O III{$]$} lambda5007 survey for PNe in five galaxies that were hosts of well-observed SNe Ia: NGC 524, NGC 1316, NGC 1380, NGC 1448, and NGC 4526. The goals of this survey are to better quantify the zero point of the maximum magnitude-decline rate relation for SNe Ia and to validate the insensitivity of Type Ia luminosity to parent stellar population using the host galaxy Hubble type as a surrogate. We detected a total of 45 PN candidates in NGC 1316, 44 candidates in NGC 1380, and 94 candidates in NGC 4526. From these data and the empirical planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF), we derive distances of 17.9<SUP>+0.8</SUP><SUB>-0.9</SUB>, 16.1<SUP>+0.8</SUP><SUB>-1.1</SUB>, and 13.6<SUP>+1.3</SUP><SUB>-1.2</SUB> Mpc, respectively. Our derived distance to NGC 4526 has a lower precision due to the likely presence of Virgo intracluster PNe in the foreground of this galaxy. In NGC 524 and NGC 1448 we detected no PN candidates down to the limiting magnitudes of our observations. We present a formalism for setting realistic distance limits in these two cases and derive robust lower limits of 20.9 and 15.8 Mpc, respectively. After combining these results with other distances from the PNLF, Cepheid, and surface brightness fluctuation distance indicators, we calibrate the optical and NIR relations for SNe Ia and find that the Hubble constants derived from each of the three methods are broadly consistent, implying that the properties of SNe Ia do not vary drastically as a function of stellar population. We determine a preliminary Hubble constant of H<SUB>0</SUB>=77+/-3 (random)+/-5 (systematic) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> for the PNLF, although more nearby galaxies with high-quality observations are clearly needed.  The WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

M96 is a spiral galaxy in the Leo I group that has a Cepheid-based distance. Our photometry allows us to calculate the absolute magnitude and reddening of this supernova. These data, when combined with measurements of the four other well-observed supernovae with Cepheid-based distances, allow us to calculate the Hubble constant with respect to the Hubble flow defined by the distant Cal�n/Tololo Type Ia sample. We find a Hubble constant of 63.9+/-2.2(internal)+/-3.5(external) km s^-1 Mpc^-1, consistent with most previous estimates based on Type Ia supernovae. We note that the two well-observed Type Ia supernovae in Fornax, if placed at the Cepheid distance to the possible Fornax spiral NGC 1365, are apparently too faint with respect to the Cal�n/Tololo sample calibrated with the five Type Ia supernovae with Cepheid distances to the host galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia SN 1998bu in the Leo I Group galaxy M96 (NGC 3368). The data set consists of 356 photometric measurements and 29 spectra of SN 1998bu between UT 1998 May 11 and July 15. The well-sampled light curve indicates the supernova reached maximum light in B on UT 1998 May 19.3 (JD 2450952.8+/-0.8) with B=12.22+/-0.03 and V=11.88+/-0.02. Application of a revised version of the Multicolor Light Curve Shape (MLCS) method yields an extinction toward the supernova of A<SUB>V</SUB>=0.94+/-0.15 mag, and indicates the supernova was of average luminosity compared to other normal Type Ia supernovae. Using the HST Cepheid distance modulus to M96 and the MLCS fitted parameters for the supernova, we derive an extinction-corrected absolute magnitude for SN 1998bu at maximum, M<SUB>V</SUB>=-19.42+/-0.22. Our independent results for this supernova are consistent with those of Suntzeff et al.

	Abstract = {We report extensive optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova 1989B. Maximum light in B occurred approximately seven days after discovery on JD 2447565.3 +/- 1.0 (1989 February 7.8 +/- 1.0) at a magnitude of 12.34 +/- 0.05. The UBV light curves of this supernova were very similar to those of other well observed Type Ia events such as SN 1981B and SN 1980N. From a comparison of the UBVRIJHK photometry, we derive an extinction for SN 1989B of E(B-V) = 0.37 +/- 0.03 mags relative to the unobscured Type Ia SN 1980N. The properties of the dust responsible for the reddening of SN 1989B appear to have been similar to those of normal dust in the Milky Way. In particular, we find no evidence for an unusually low value of the ratio of the total to selective absorption. We derive a distance modulus of delta mu<SUB>0</SUB> = -1.62 +/- 0.03 mag relative to the Type Ia SN 1980N. We present optical spectra which provide essentially continuous coverage of the spectral evolution of SN 1989B over the first month following B maximum. These data show the transition from the maximum-light spectrum, in which lines of elements such as Ca, Si, S, Mg, and O are most prominent, to the Fe-dominated spectrum observed a few weeks after maximum. This transition occurred quite smoothly over a two-week period following B maximum. Comparison of the spectra of SN 1989B with data for two other well observed Type Ia supernovae -- 1981B and 1986G -- reveals subtle differences in the relative strengths of the S II and Si II absorption lines at maximum light. However, these differences disappeared within a week or so after maximum with the onset of the Fe-dominated phase.},

	Abstract = {Results are presented on the optical photometry of two supernovae, 1980N and 1981D, in the D-type galaxy NGC 1316 (Fornax A). These observations are combined with earlier data to construct definitive light curves of the two supernovae, and the light curves and the color evolution of both supernovae are compared with average curves constructed by previous investigators. It is found that the shapes of the UBV light curves of 1980N closely resembles those of the type Ia prototype SN 1981B. The optical spectrum of SN 1980N taken 30 days after the B maximum is virtually identical to a spectrum of SN 1981B obtained at the same point in its evolution. These findings support claims that the majority of the type Ia supernovae form a highly homogeneous class of objects.},

In this case study, we apply the method to 12 high-redshift (0.212 <= z <= 0.912) SNe Ia observed by the Supernova Cosmology Project. Through measurements of the strengths of these features and of the blueshift of the absorption minimum in Ca ii H&K, we show that the spectra of the high-redshift SNe Ia are quantitatively similar to spectra of nearby SNe Ia (z < 0.15). One supernova in our high redshift sample, SN 2002fd at z = 0.279, is found to have spectral characteristics that are associated with peculiar SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like supernovae.},

	Abstract = {The feasibility of using near-infrared observations to discover supernovae in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of nearby starburst galaxies is investigated. We provide updated estimates of the intrinsic core-collapse supernova rates in these regions. We discuss the problem of extinction, and present new estimates of the extinction towards 33 supernova remnants in the starburst galaxy M 82. This is done using Hi and H<SUB>2</SUB> column density measurements. We estimate the molecular to atomic hydrogen mass ratio to be 7.4+/-1.0 in M 82. We have assembled near-infrared photometric data for a total of 13 core-collapse supernovae, some unpublished hitherto. This constitutes the largest database of infrared light curves for such events. We show that the infrared light curves fall into two classes, `ordinary' and `slowly declining'. Template JHKL light curves are derived for both classes. For ordinary core-collapse supernovae, the average peak JHKL absolute magnitudes are -18.4, -18.6, -18.6 and -19.0 respectively. The slowly declining core-collapse supernovae are found to be significantly more luminous than the ordinary events, even at early times, having average peak JHKL absolute magnitudes of -19.9, -20.0, -20.0 and -20.4 respectively. We investigate the efficiency of a computerized image subtraction method in supernova detection. We then carry out a Monte Carlo simulation of a supernova search using K-band images of NGC 5962. The effects of extinction and observing strategy are discussed. We conclude that a modest observational programme will be able to discover a number of nuclear supernovae.},

Three supernovae were discovered in a surveyed area of 1.7 deg^2^. The survey spanned a ~3 week baseline and used images with 3 sigma limiting magnitudes of R ~ 23. We present our methods for estimating the numbers of galaxies and the number of solar luminosities to which the survey is sensitive, as well as the supernova detection efficiency, which is used to determine the control time, the effective time for which the survey is sensitive to a Type Ia event.

	Abstract = {We create new U-, B-, V-, R- and I-band light-curve templates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and re-analyse 122 nearby (redshift < 0.11) SNe Ia using a new `Multiband Stretch method', which is a revised Stretch method extended to five bands. We find (i) our I-band template can fit about 90 per cent of SNe Ia I-band light curves, (ii) relationships between luminosity, colours and stretch factors, (iii) possible subgroups of SNe Ia and (iv) the ratio of total to selective extinction R in other galaxies can be consistent with that in the Milky Way under the assumption that SNe Ia have diversity in their intrinsic colour. Based on these results, we discuss how to select subsets of SNe Ia to serve as good distance indicators for cosmology. We find two possibilities: one is to choose `BV bluest' [-0.14 < (B - V)<SUB>max</SUB> <= -0.10] objects and the other is to use only SNe Ia which occur in E or S0 galaxies. Within these subsets, we find the root mean square (rms) of peak B-band magnitudes is 0.17 mag (`BV bluest' sample) and 0.12 mag (E or S0 sample).},

@article{Qiu:1999,
	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic and photometric results of SN 1996cb. The supernova was independently discovered in NGC 3510 by M. Aoki, T. Cho, & K. Toyama of Japan and Qiao et al. of Beijing Astronomical Observatory on 1996 December 15 and 18, respectively. The results cover about 6 months following the discovery. The first few spectra showed strong Balmer lines with obvious P Cygni profiles, offering evidence of a Type II supernova. The emergence of He I lines could be inferred in these spectra. That the He I lines became quite prominent in the spectra near optical maximum confirmed that SN 1996cb was definitely a Type IIb supernova, like SN 1987K and SN 1993J. The photometric results showed that the B-I color evolution was very similar to that of SN 1993J. Comparing two color curves, we were able to estimate that the explosion of SN 1996cb occurred on UT 1996 December 12. Although the overall light curves resembled that of SN 1993J, they showed some differences, especially for the B band. SN 1996cb had a broad peak in the light curves, and it declined somewhat slowly and, compared with SN 1993J, exhibited a plateau-like shape between 20 and 50 days after the maximum for the B and V bands. This indicates that there was relatively more hydrogen in the outer envelope of the progenitor of SN 1996cb. The spectral evolution of SN 1996cb displayed further differences from SN 1993J. In the case of SN 1996cb, the Balmer lines showed strong P Cygni profiles at a very early time, resembling the early spectra of SN 1987A, a supernova resulting from a compact blue supergiant star. The dramatic changes of expansion velocities at early times indicated that the photosphere of SN 1996cb receded more quickly than it did in SN 1993J. The He I lines emerged much earlier and evolved more dramatically, causing SN 1996cb to display the features of a Type Ib supernova before maximum. This might be the result of a dramatic recession of the photosphere at an early time; the He I lines and [O I] lines showed conspicuous blueshifts when they emerged, resembling the blueshifts of the [O I] lines that appeared in the late spectra of SN 1993J. This is probably observational evidence of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities occurring at the interfaces between the H and He and the He and O+C layers, respectively; Halpha emission and absorption components, especially the latter, were conspicuous 100 days after the explosion. We also conclude that the outer envelope of SN 1996cb had relatively more hydrogen than was the case for SN 1993J, even though the amount remained much less than is typical of other Type II supernovae. This finding is consistent with the results of the photometry. The [O I] and O lines emerged very late and exhibited weak emission, indicating that the He-rich layer was relatively thick. Combining the analyses of photometric and spectroscopic evolution, we conclude that the progenitor of SN 1996cb, like that of SN 1993J, was a stripped massive star exhibiting some special features: it was probably a more compact star with a thick helium layer and a relatively more massive hydrogen envelope.},

	Abstract = {Attention is given to Cousins system VRI photometry obtained for the Type Ia supernova 1992G with CCDs attached to small telescopes at Leuschner Observatory, Van Vleck Observatory (VVO), and Whitin Observatory. Two other Type Ia supernovae, 1991M and 1991T, were observed only at VVO. The I template shows a secondary maximum 23 +/- 1 d after the primary peak, similar to what is seen in normal Type Ia supernovae at J, H, and K wavelengths. The behavior in R is intermediate between V and I. The observed colors of SN 1991M and SN1991T as a function of time are quite similar, indicating that they suffer about the same amount of reddening. If Type Ia supernovae are assumed to be good standard candles, then NGC 4527, the parent galaxy of SN 1991T, must have a peculiar velocity of 1200 +/- 150 km/s relative to the Hubble flow and directed away from the galaxy. If the peculiar velocity of NGC 4527 is less than this, then SN 1991T must be an overluminous SN Ia.},

@article{Leonard:2002,
	Abstract = {We present optical spectra and photometry sampling the first 6 months after discovery of supernova (SN) 1999gi in NGC 3184. SN 1999gi is shown to be a Type II-plateau event with a photometric plateau lasting until about 100 days after discovery. Using the expanding photosphere method (EPM), we derive a distance to SN 1999gi of 11.1<SUP>+2.0</SUP><SUB>-1.8</SUB> Mpc and an explosion date of 1999 December 5.8<SUP>+3.0</SUP><SUB>-3.1</SUB>, or 4.1<SUP>+3.0</SUP><SUB>-3.1</SUB> days prior to discovery. This distance is consistent with a Tully-Fisher distance recently derived to NGC 3184 (D~11.59 Mpc), but it is somewhat closer than the Cepheid distances recently derived to two galaxies that have generally been assumed to be associated with the group containing NGC 3184 (NGC 3319, D=13.30+/-0.55 Mpc, and NGC 3198, D=13.80+/-0.51 Mpc). From many lines of evidence, we conclude that SN 1999gi is only minimally reddened. A comparison between the color of SN 1999gi at early times and that of an infinitely hot blackbody restricts the reddening to E(B-V)<0.45 mag, while a comparison between the color evolution of SN 1999gi and the well-observed (and extensively modeled) Type II-P SN 1999em implies an even more restrictive upper reddening limit of E(B-V)<0.3 mag. A variety of other, independent reddening estimates are consistent with these upper limits and yield a probable reddening of E(B-V)=0.21+/-0.09 mag. We reconsider the upper mass limit (9<SUP>+3</SUP><SUB>-2</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) recently placed on the progenitor star of SN 1999gi by Smartt et al. in light of these results. Following the same procedures, but using the new data presented here, we arrive at a less restrictive upper mass limit of 15<SUP>+5</SUP><SUB>-3</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for the progenitor. The increased upper limit results mainly from the larger distance derived through the EPM than was assumed by the Smartt et al. analyses, which relied on less precise (and less recent) distance measurements to NGC 3184. Finally, we confirm the existence of ``complicated'' P Cygni line profiles in early-time and later photospheric-phase spectra of SN 1999gi. These features, first identified by Baron et al. in spectra of SN 1999em as high-velocity absorptions, in addition to the ``normal'' lower velocity component, are here verified to be true P Cygni profiles consisting of both an absorption trough and an emission peak at early times. In the earliest spectrum, taken less than a day after discovery, the features extend out to nearly -30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating the existence of very high velocity material in the outer envelope of SN 1999gi.},

	Abstract = {We report optical and infrared spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia SN 1999ee and the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex, both of which were hosted by the galaxy IC 5179. For SN 1999ee we obtained a continuous sequence with an unprecedented wavelength and temporal coverage beginning 9 days before maximum light and extending through day 42. Before maximum light SN 1999ee displayed a normal spectrum with a strong Si II lambda6355 absorption, thus showing that not all slow-declining supernovae (SNe) are spectroscopically peculiar at these evolutionary phases. A comparative study of the infrared spectra of SN 1999ee and other Type Ia SNe shows that there is a remarkable homogeneity among the Branch-normal SNe Ia during their first 60 days of evolution. SN 1991bg-like objects, on the other hand, display spectroscopic peculiarities at infrared wavelengths. SN 1999ex was characterized by the lack of hydrogen lines, weak optical He I lines, and strong He I lambdalambda10830, 20581, thus providing an example of an intermediate case between pure Ib and Ic supernovae. We conclude, therefore, that SN 1999ex provides the first clear evidence for a link between the Ib and Ic classes and that there is a continuous spectroscopic sequence ranging from the He-deficient SNe Ic to the SNe Ib, which are characterized by strong optical He I lines. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (program ESO 164.H-0376).},

The reddening along the line of sight to this supernova is uncertain--there is evidence for small (E(B-V) approximately equals 0.08 mag) and moderate (E(B-V) approximately equals 0.32 mag) values. For each value, we correct the observed fluxes for extinction and calculate the evolution of the sum of all optical flux, which contains roughly half of the supernova's total flux during the period of observation. We also fit the colors to a Planck function, and determine the temperature and total luminosity of the supernova for each value of reddening. A peculiar Type II supernova, SN 1993J gradually evolved spectroscopically to resemble a Type Ib in some respects. We compare its boloometric evolution with that of the prototypical Type Ib SN 1983N, and find the two to be similar.},

	Abstract = {We present BVRI photometry of SN 1993J, as well as data on its likely progenitor. The post-explosion data were obtained with charge coupled devices (CCDs) attached to telescopes (aperture size 0.4 to 0.6 m) on the campuses of the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium members by the authors and their students. Our data show that the supernova rose to a second maximum in all colors and has declined steadily since then. This is unlike either the plateau or linear version of the typical Type II light curve. Except for the initial peak, the light curve bears a strong resemblance to SNe Ib, supporting suggestions that this is a Type IIb event. The position of the supernova, as measured on our images, agrees to within 0.1 arcsec with the position of a faint, apparently stellar image on a CCD R image taken with the 0.9 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) on 1992 October 2. The likely progenitor is also visible on B and I frames taken with the 0.9 m Burrell Schmidt telescope of the Warner and Swasey Observatory, Case Western Reserve University, at KPNO in 1993 February. Examination of a photograph of M81 taken on 1993 March 27.1 (UT) by an amateur astronomer allows us to set a constraint on its brightness at the time.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2002ap in M74 was discovered on 2002 January 29. Being one of the nearest (10Mpc) SN events in the last decades, and spectroscopically similar to the so-called `hypernovae' 1997ef and 1998bw, both possibly associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), it is of great interest. Shortly after its discovery, we launched an intensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of this event, and here we report the results of the first month of observations. We use our UBVRI photometry to estimate the magnitudes at, and dates of, peak brightness. Our data suggest that this object reached its peak B-band luminosity on February 7.1<SUP>+2</SUP><SUB>-1.3<SUB>UT</SUB></SUB>. Based on its similarity to SN 1998bw, we estimate the range of possible dates for a GRB that may have been associated with SN 2002ap. We find that it may include dates outside the time frame for which all available gamma-ray data have been intensively scanned, according to recent reports. The absolute magnitude at peak brightness of SN 2002ap (M<SUB>B</SUB>=-16.9) shows that it was significantly fainter than SN 1998bw, or normal Type Ia SNe, but similar to SN 1997ef. Our spectroscopic observations confirm that SN 2002ap is strikingly similar to SNe 1998bw and 1997ef. We briefly describe the spectral evolution of this object. To assist other observers and to stimulate theoretical models, we make our entire data set publicly available in digital form (http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~avishay/local.html).},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2002ap in M74 was observed in the UBVRIJHK bands for the first 40 days following its discovery (2002 January 29) until it disappeared as a result of solar conjunction and then in June after it reappeared. The magnitudes and dates of peak brightness in each band were determined. While the rate of increase of the brightness before the peak is almost independent of wavelength, the subsequent rate of decrease becomes smaller with wavelength from the U to the R bands and is constant at wavelengths beyond the I band. The photometric evolution is faster than in the well-known ``hypernovae'' SNe 1998bw and 1997ef, indicating that SN 2002ap ejected less mass. The bolometric light curve of SN 2002ap for the full period of observations was constructed. The absolute magnitude is found to be much fainter than that of SN 1998bw but is similar to that of SN 1997ef, which lies at the faint end of the hypernova population. The bolometric light curve at the early epochs was best reproduced with the explosion of a C+O star that ejects 2.5M<SUB>solar</SUB> with kinetic energy E<SUB>K</SUB>=4�10<SUP>51</SUP>ergs. A comparison of the predicted brightness of SN 2002ap with that observed after solar conjunction may imply that gamma-ray deposition at the later epochs was more efficient than in the model. This may be due to an asymmetric explosion.},

Photometric coverage includes UBVRI bands from 2002 January 30, the day after discovery, through 2002 December 12. There are five early-time spectra and eight in the nebular phase. We determine that SN 2002ap is similar to SN 1997ef and the gamma-ray burst-associated SN 1998bw with respect to spectral and photometric characteristics. The nebular spectra of SN 2002ap present the largest Mg I] lambda4571 to [O I] lambdalambda6300, 6364 ratio of any supernova spectra yet published, suggesting that the progenitor of SN 2002ap was a highly stripped star.

We also present nebular modeling of SN 2002ap and find that the object ejected >~1.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB> of material within the outer velocity shell of the nebula (~5500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and synthesized ~0.09 M<SUB>solar</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni.},

The magnitudes were determined using a direct integration technique after removing the local sky background fitted with a quadratic surface. A nearby star (TB 135) was used as a reference star. The estimated accuracy of the results was within +/-0.05 mag when the SN was brighter than 14 mag, while it was around +/-0.1 mag when the SN became fainter. The brightness of the supernova declined steeply (about 0.1 mag per day) after reaching maximum brightnesses on April 8-9 (V band) and on April 10-11 (R and I bands). The rate of decline slowed down to about 0.03 mag per day about 20 d after the maximum. Our results are consistent with the classification of SN 1994I as a Type Ic event.},

	Abstract = {Photometric measurements show that, as a group, nearby Type Ia supernovae follow similar light curves and reach similar peak magnitudes (Branch & Tammann 1992). Thus, these supernovae may serve as standard candles or calibrated candles at cosmological distances. Magnitudes of local and distant supernovae, both in the same filter band, are compared using a K correction to account for the different spectral regions incident on that filter. A generalized approach compares magnitudes in different bands for the nearby and distant supernovae, bands that are selected to give sensitivity in corresponding regions of the unredshifted and redshifted spectra. Thus, R magnitudes for supernovae at z ~ 0.5 are compared with B magnitudes of local supernovae. We compute these generalized K corrections over a range of redshifts and bandpass pairs and discuss their advantages over the traditional single-band K correction. In particular, errors near maximum light can be kept below 0.05 mag out to at least z = 0.6, whereas the traditional K correction is less accurate and can be difficult to determine beyond z > 0.2.

	Abstract = {We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2000cx in the S0 galaxy NGC 524, which reveal it to be peculiar. Photometrically, SN 2000cx is different from all known SNe Ia, and its light curves cannot be fitted well by the fitting techniques currently available. There is an apparent asymmetry in the B-band peak, in which the premaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal SN 1994D), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of the overluminous SN 1991T). The color evolution of SN 2000cx is also peculiar: the (B-V)<SUB>0</SUB> color has a unique plateau phase and the (V-R)<SUB>0</SUB> and (V-I)<SUB>0</SUB> colors are very blue. Although the premaximum spectra of SN 2000cx are similar to those of SN 1991T-like objects (with weak Si II lines), its overall spectral evolution is quite different. The Si II lines that emerged near maximum B-band brightness stay strong in SN 2000cx until about 3 weeks past maximum. The change in the excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. Both the iron-peak and the intermediate-mass elements are found to be moving at very high expansion velocities in the ejecta of SN 2000cx. We discuss theoretical models for SN 2000cx. SN 2000cx may be an overluminous object like SN 1991T, but with a larger yield of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni and a higher kinetic energy in the ejecta. We also briefly discuss the implications of our observations for the luminosity versus light-curve width relation.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic and extensive photometric observations of supernova (SN) 1998de in the S0 galaxy NGC 252, discovered during the course of the Lick Observatory Supernova Search. These data, which span a time period of 8 days before to 76 days after B-band maximum, unambiguously establish SN 1998de as a peculiar and subluminous Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with strong similarities to SN 1991bg, the prototype of these intrinsically dim SNe Ia. We find that SN 1998de, which has Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)=1.95+/-0.09 mag, rises and declines much faster than normal SNe Ia and does not exhibit the usual plateau in the R band. In the I band it shows a short plateau phase or possibly a secondary maximum, soon after the first maximum. We find that subluminous SNe Ia with the same value of Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B) can have slightly different light curves at longer wavelengths. The notable spectroscopic similarities between SN 1998de and SN 1991bg are the wide Ti II trough at 4100-4500 �, the strong Ca II features, and the early onset of the nebular phase. We observe that spectroscopic deviations of SN 1998de from SN 1991bg increase toward redder wavelengths. These deviations include the absence of the conspicuous Na I D absorption found in SN 1991bg at 5700 � and the evolution of a region (6800-7600 �) from featureless to feature-rich. Several lines of evidence suggest that SN 1998de was a slightly more powerful explosion than SN 1991bg. We discuss the implications of our observations for progenitor models and the explosion mechanism of peculiar, subluminous SNe Ia. The extensive photometric data make SN 1998de a better template than SN 1991bg for calibrating the low-luminosity end of the luminosity versus decline rate relationship.},

	Abstract = {We present UBVRIJHK photometry and optical spectroscopy of the so-called peculiar Type Ia supernova 1999by in NGC 2841. The observations began 1 week before visual maximum light, which is well defined by daily observations. The light curves and spectra are similar to those of the prototypical subluminous event SN 1991bg. We find that maximum light in B occurred on 1999 May 10.3 UT (JD 2,451,308.8+/-0.3) with B=13.66+/-0.02 and a color of B<SUB>max</SUB>-V<SUB>max</SUB>=0.51+/-0.03. The late-time color implies minimal dust extinction from the host galaxy. Our photometry, when combined with the recent Cepheid distance to NGC 2841, gives a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>B</SUB>=-17.15+/-0.23, making SN 1999by one of the least luminous Type Ia events ever observed. We estimate a decline rate parameter of Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)=1.90 mag, versus 1.93 for SN 1991bg, for which 1.10 is typical for so-called normal events. We compare SN 1999by with other subluminous events and find that the B<SUB>max</SUB>-V<SUB>max</SUB> color correlates strongly with the decline rate and may be a more sensitive indicator of luminosity than the fading rate for these objects. We find a good correlation between luminosity and the depth of the spectral feature at 580 nm, which had been attributed solely to Si II. We show that in cooler photospheres the 580 nm feature is dominated by Ti II, which provides a simple physical explanation for the correlation. Using only subluminous Type Ia supernovae, we derive a Hubble parameter of H<SUB>0</SUB>=75<SUP>+12</SUP><SUB>-11</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with values found from brighter events.},

V-K colors become bluer linearly with time from roughly one week before B-band maximum until one week after maximum, after which they redden linearly until four weeks after maximum. V-H colors exhibit very similar color evolution. V-J colors exhibit slightly more complex evolution, with greater scatter. The existence of V-near-infrared (NIR) color relations allows the construction of near-infrared light-curve templates that are an improvement on those of Elias et al. from 1985. We provide optical BVRI and infrared JHK photometry of the Type Ia supernovae 1999aa, 1999cl, and 1999cp. SN 1999aa is an overluminous ``slow decliner'' (with Delta=-0.47 mag). SN 1999cp is a moderately bright SN unreddened in its host. SN 1999cl is extremely reddened in its host. The V-NIR colors of SN 1999cl yield A<SUB>V</SUB>=2.01+/-0.11 mag. This leads to a distance for its host galaxy (M88) in agreement with other distance measurements for members of the Virgo Cluster.},

	Abstract = {Extensive light and colour curves for the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2002er are presented as part of the European Supernova Collaboration. We have collected UBVRI photometry from 11 different telescopes covering the phases from 7 d before until 619 d after maximum light. Corrections for the different instrumental systems and the non-thermal spectrum of the supernova (S-corrections) have been applied. With the densely sampled light curves we can make detailed comparisons to other well-observed objects. SN 2002er most closely resembles SN 1996X after maximum, but clearly shows a different colour evolution before peak light and a stronger shoulder in V and R bands compared to other well-observed SNe Ia. In particular, the rise time appears to be longer than what is expected from the rise time versus decline rate relation. We use several methods to determine the reddening towards SN 2002er based on the colour evolution at near peak and at late phases. The uvoir (bolometric) light curve shows great similarity with SN 1996X, but also indications of a higher luminosity, longer rise time and a more pronounced shoulder 25 d past maximum. The interpretation of the light curves was carried out with two independent light curve codes. Both find that given the luminosity of SN 2002er the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass exceeds 0.6 M<SUB>solar</SUB> with preferred values near 0.7 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Uncertainties in the exact distance to SN 2002er are the most serious limitation of this measurement. The light-curve modelling also indicates a high level of mixing of the nickel in the explosion of SN 2002er.},

The combined optical and IR spectra of SN 1994D reveal a flux `deficit' in the R, I and J bands as early as maximum light. They also illustrate the dramatic deepening of the J-band deficit after maximum light. We also present a maximum light IR spectrum of the peculiar Type Ia SN 1991T. This also shows a deficit in the J band, but it does not show such a pronounced deficit in the R and I bands as SN 1994D. Both supernovae show a P Cygni-like feature with the absorption at ~1.05 mum and the emission at ~1.08 mum. In SN 1994D the absorption shows no wavelength shift during the period between -8.5 and -1.5 d before maximum light. After this the feature rapidly weakened. We argue that, in this event, the P Cygni line feature formed in a discrete shell-like zone lying above the photosphere. In SN 1991T a continuous, shallow density gradient scattering zone seems more appropriate. For both supernovae we explore possible identifications with HeI 1.0830 mum and MgII 1.0926 mum, but there are difficulties with either option. In SN 1994D it may be that the feature is actually the result of a blend of the helium and magnesium lines. However, for both supernovae it is not ruled out that the J-band feature is really the result of a transition in one or more unidentified species. Consideration of the velocities associated with the feature indicates that, if its origin is helium, then in SN 1994D it is more likely that it formed in the alpha-rich freeze-out, but some mixing to higher velocities is also required. In contrast, in SN 1991T we favour an origin in the form of a residual or accreted layer on the surface of the progenitor white dwarf. If the feature is due to magnesium then the derived velocities for SN 1994D are in good agreement with the predictions of explosion model W7. In SN 1991T, identification with magnesium presents problems in accounting for the inferred velocity structure.},

@article{Patat:1996,
	Abstract = {The type Ia supernova SN 1994D in NGC 4526 was extensively observed as a target of opportunity at ESO. In this paper, we present and discuss the UBVRI photometry and the spectra collected during this campaign from 11 days before maximum to about two months afterwards. Several absorption components of the NaID lines arising in our Galaxy, in NGC 4526 and in high-velocity clouds located in between have been identified in a high-resolution spectrum. The total amount of reddening related to these features has been estimated as E(B-V)=0.06. The light curve shapes are similar, but not identical, to those of SN 1992A. The onset of the secondary maximum in the I band occurs around day +20. The SN reached at maximum B=11.84 and showed a distinctly blue colour [(B-V)=-0.08]. SN 1994D is therefore the bluest SN Ia observed to date. SN 1994D appears to depart from the previously reported correlation between maximum brightness and rate of decay. The implications of this for the absolute magnitudes and colour dispersion of type IaSNe are discussed. The spectroscopic evolution of SN 1994D followed that of standard objects like SN 1992A. The excellent time coverage allowed us to show a sudden break in the decline rate of the expansion velocity deduced from the SiIIlambda6355 line at around day -6, probably indicating that after this phase this strong feature originates well above the photosphere. Finally, physical parameters and line identifications have been obtained modelling the day -4 spectrum by means of a spectrum synthesis code. Overall, the spectrum is successfully fitted as a normal SNIa, although the very blue colour cannot be reproduced. The observed weakness of the CoII absorption around 3350A and its possible bearing on the amount of radioactive Ni produced during the explosion are discussed.},

@article{Stritzinger:2002,
	Abstract = {We present UBVRIz light curves of the Type Ia SN 1999ee and the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex, both located in the galaxy IC 5179. SN 1999ee has an extremely well-sampled light curve spanning from 10 days before B<SUB>max</SUB> through 53 days after peak. Near maximum, we find systematic differences of ~0.05 mag in photometry measured with two different telescopes, even though the photometry is reduced to the same local standards around the supernova using the specific color terms for each instrumental system. We use models for our bandpasses and spectrophotometry of SN 1999ee to derive magnitude corrections (S-corrections) and remedy this problem. This exercise demonstrates the need of accurately characterizing the instrumental system before great photometric accuracies of Type Ia supernovae can be claimed. It also shows that this effect can have important astrophysical consequences, since a small systematic shift of 0.02 mag in the B-V color can introduce a 0.08 mag error in the extinction-corrected peak B magnitude of a supernova and thus lead to biased cosmological parameters. The data for the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex present us with the first ever observed shock breakout of a supernova of this class. These observations show that shock breakout occurred 18 days before B<SUB>max</SUB> and support the idea that Type Ib/c supernovae are due to the core collapse of massive stars rather than thermonuclear disruption of white dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We report observations of two nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) for which observations of Cepheid variables in the host galaxies have been obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope: SN 1994ae in NGC 3370 and SN 1998aq in NGC 3982. For NCG 3370, we used the Advanced Camera for Surveys to observe 64 Cepheids that yield a distance of 29 Mpc, the farthest direct measurement of Cepheids. We have measured emission lines from H II regions in both host galaxies that provide metallicity-dependent corrections to their period-luminosity relations. These two SNe Ia double the sample of ``ideal'' luminosity calibrators: objects with well-observed and well-calibrated light curves of typical shape and with low reddening. By comparing them to all similarly well-measured SNe Ia in the Hubble flow, we find that H<SUB>0</SUB>=73+/-4(statistical)+/-5(systematic) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. A detailed analysis demonstrates that most of the past disagreement over the value of H<SUB>0</SUB> as determined from SNe Ia is abated by the replacement of past, problematic data by more accurate and precise, modern data.

This fact is used to calibrate the dependence of the B_max-V_max and V_max-I_max colors on the light-curve decline rate parameter Deltam_15(B), which can, in turn, be used to separately estimate the host galaxy extinction. Using these methods to eliminate the effects of reddening, we reexamine the functional form of the decline rate versus luminosity relationship and provide an updated estimate of the Hubble constant of H_0=63.3+/-2.2(internal)+/-3.5(external) km s^-1 Mpc^-1.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of the cosmological parameters from Type Ia supernovae hinges on our ability to compare nearby and distant supernovae accurately. Here we present an advance on a method for performing generalized K-corrections for Type Ia supernovae that allows us to compare these objects from the UV to near-IR over the redshift range 0<z<2. We discuss the errors currently associated with this method and how future data can improve upon it significantly. We also examine the effects of reddening on the K-corrections and the light curves of Type Ia supernovae. Finally, we provide a few examples of how these techniques affect our current understanding of a sample of both nearby and distant supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We have derived extinctions A(lambda)/A(V) at the wavelengths of the uvby filters for 22 stars, with a range of values of R<SUB>nu</SUB>, from the sample of Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989, hereafter CCM). We have fit these extinctions, and also UBVRIJHKL, IUE and ANS extinction measurements, with linear relations A(lambda)/A/(V) = a+b/R<SUB>nu</SUB> and fit a and b as a function of x(=1/lambda) with polynomials to obtain an R<SUB>nu</SUB>-dependent mean extinction law (A(x)/A(V) = a(x) + b(x)/R<SUB>nu</SUB>)in the optical and near-ultraviolet (1.1/micrometer less than or equal to 3.3/micrometer). This law is virtually identical to the CCM extinction law for large values of R<SUB>nu</SUB>(R<SUB>nu</SUB> approximately 5) but is slightly lower in the near-ultraviolet for smaller R<SUB>nu</SUB> (R<SUB>nu</SUB> approximately 3). The extinction law presented here agrees much better with a high-resolution extinction curve for the diffuse interstellar medium (R<SUB>nu</SUB> approximately 3.1), presented by Bastiaansen (1992), than CCM. The deviations of individual extinction curves from the mean are dominated by observational errors. The wavelength resolution of this work is not high enough to show evidence for or against the existence of very broad structure in optical extinction curves.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

@article{Schlegel:1998,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

Even though the model has no core-collapse SNe within 3 kpc of the center, a considerable fraction of the core-collapse SNe are projected into the inner regions of inclined parent galaxies owing to their small vertical scale height. The model predicts that because of extinction, SNe that are projected into the central regions should, on average, appear dimmer and have a much larger magnitude scatter than those in the outer regions. In particular, the model predicts a strong deficit of bright core-collapse events inside a projected radius of a few kiloparsec. Such a deficit is found to be present in the observations. It appears to be a natural consequence of the characteristic spatial distributions of dust and core-collapse SNe in galaxies, and it leads us to offer an alternative to the conventional interpretation of the Shaw effect.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for selecting high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) located via rolling SN searches. The technique, using both color and magnitude information of events from only two to three epochs of multiband real-time photometry, is able to discriminate between SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. Furthermore, for SNe Ia the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase, and light-curve parameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe, where the selection method effectively rejects most core-collapse SNe while retaining SNe Ia. We also apply the selection code to real-time data acquired as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). During the period 2004 May to 2005 January in the SNLS, 440 SN candidates were discovered, of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopically as SNe Ia and 15 as core-collapse events. For this test data set, the selection technique correctly identifies 100% of the identified SNe II as non-SNe Ia with only a 1%-2% false rejection rate. The predicted parameterization of the SNe Ia has a precision of Deltaz/(1+z<SUB>spec</SUB>)<0.09 in redshift and +/-2-3 rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planning spectroscopic follow-up observations. We also investigate any bias introduced by this selection method on the ability of surveys such as SNLS to measure cosmological parameters (e.g., w and Omega<SUB>M</SUB>) and find any effect to be negligible.},

	Abstract = {Optical observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005bl in NGC 4070, obtained from -6 to +66d with respect to the B-band maximum, are presented. The photometric evolution is characterized by rapidly declining light curves [Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)<SUB>true</SUB> = 1.93] and red colours at peak and soon thereafter. With M<SUB>B,max</SUB> = -17.24 the SN is an underluminous SN Ia, similar to the peculiar SNe 1991bg and 1999by. This similarity also holds for the spectroscopic appearance, the only remarkable difference being the likely presence of carbon in pre-maximum spectra of SN 2005bl. A comparison study among underluminous SNe Ia is performed, based on a number of spectrophotometric parameters. Previously reported correlations of the light-curve decline rate with peak luminosity and (Si) are confirmed, and a large range of post-maximum SiII lambda6355 velocity gradients is encountered. 1D synthetic spectra for SN 2005bl are presented, which confirm the presence of carbon and suggest an overall low burning efficiency with a significant amount of leftover unburned material. Also, the Fe content in pre-maximum spectra is very low, which may point to a low metallicity of the precursor. Implications for possible progenitor scenarios of underluminous SNe Ia are briefly discussed.  Based on observations at ESO-Paranal, Programme 075.D-0662(B).  E-mail: tauben@mpa-garching.mpg.de},

	Abstract = {We use a sample of 42 supernovae detected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey to measure the rate of core-collapse supernovae to z~0.7 and Type Ia supernovae to z~1.6. This significantly increases the redshift range at which supernova rates have been estimated from observations. The rate of core-collapse supernovae can be used as an independent probe of the cosmic star formation rate. Based on the observations of 17 core-collapse supernovae, we measure an increase in the core-collapse supernova rate by a factor of ~1.6 in the range 0.3<z<0.7 and an overall increase by a factor of ~7 to z~0.7 in comparison with the local core-collapse supernova rate. The increase in the rate in this redshift range is consistent with recent measurements of the star formation rate derived from UV-luminosity densities and IR data sets. Based on 25 Type Ia supernovae, we find a Type Ia supernova rate that is a factor of 3-5 higher at z~1 compared to earlier estimates at lower redshifts (z<0.5), implying that the Type Ia supernova rate traces a higher star formation rate at redshifts z>1 compared to low redshift. At higher redshift (z>~1), we find a suggested decrease in the Type Ia rate with redshift. This evolution of the Ia rate with redshift is consistent with a Type Ia progenitor model, in which there is a substantial delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion of the supernova. Assuming that the Type Ia progenitor stars have initial main-sequence masses 3M<SUB>solar</SUB><M<8M<SUB>solar</SUB>, we find that 5%-7% of the available progenitors explode as Type Ia supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We present results from the Hubble Higher z Supernova Search, the first space-based open field survey for supernovae (SNe). In cooperation with the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope with the Advanced Camera for Surveys to cover ~300 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> in the area of the Chandra Deep Field South and the Hubble Deep Field North on five separate search epochs (separated by ~45 day intervals) to a limiting magnitude of F850LP~26. These deep observations have allowed us to discover 42 SNe in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.6. As these data span a large range in redshift, they are ideal for testing the validity of Type Ia supernova progenitor models with the distribution of expected ``delay times,'' from progenitor star formation to Type Ia SN explosion, and the SN rates these models predict. Through a Bayesian maximum likelihood test, we determine which delay-time models best reproduce the redshift distribution of SNe Ia discovered in this survey. We find that models that require a large fraction of ``prompt'' (less than 2 Gyr) SNe Ia poorly reproduce the observed redshift distribution and are rejected at greater than 95% confidence. We find that Gaussian models best fit the observed data for mean delay times in the range of 2-4 Gyr.

	Abstract = {We present multi-band photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of SN2007ax, the faintest and reddest Type Ia supernova (SNIa) yet observed. With M_B = -15.9 and (B-V)max = 1.2, this SN is over half a magnitude fainter at maximum light than any other SNIa. Similar to subluminous SN2005ke, SN2007ax also appears to show excess in UV emission at late time. Traditionally, Delta-m_15(B) has been used to parameterize the decline rate for SNeIa. However, the B-band transition from fast to slow decline occurs sooner than 15 days for faint SNeIa. Therefore we suggest that a more physically motivated parameter, the time of intersection of the two slopes, be used instead. Only by explaining the faintest (and the brightest) supernovae, we can thoroughly understand the physics of thermonuclear explosions. We suggest that future surveys should carefully design their cadence, depth, pointings and follow-up to find an unbiased sample of extremely faint members of this subclass of faint SNeIa.},

@article{Greggio:2008,
	Abstract = {Following an episode of star formation, Type Ia supernova events occur over an extended period of time, following a distribution of delay times (DDT). We critically discuss some empirically based DDT functions that have been proposed in recent years, some favouring very early (prompt) events, other very late (tardy) ones, and therefore being mutually exclusive. We point out that in both the cases the derived DDT functions are affected by dubious assumptions, and therefore there is currently no ground for claiming either a DDT strongly peaked at early times, or at late ones. Theoretical DDT functions are known to accommodate both prompt as well as late SNIa events, and can account for all available observational constraints. Recent observational evidence exist that both single and double degenerate precursors may be able of producing SNIa events. We then explore on the basis of plausible theoretical models the possible variation with cosmic time of the mix between the events produced by the two different channels, which, in principle, could lead to systematic effects on the SNIa properties with redshift.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how the different types of supernovae are relatively affected by the metallicity of their host galaxy. We match the SAI supernova catalog to the SDSS DR4 catalog of star-forming galaxies with measured metallicities. These supernova host galaxies span a range of oxygen abundance from 12+log(O/H)=7.9 to 9.3 (~0.1-2.7 solar) and a range in absolute magnitude from M<SUB>B</SUB>=-15.2 to -22.2. To reduce the various observational biases, we select a subsample of well-characterized supernovae in the redshift range from 0.01 to 0.04, which leaves us with 58 SNe II, 19 SNe Ib/c, and 38 SNe Ia. We find strong evidence that SNe Ib/c occur in higher metallicity host galaxies than SNe II, while we see no effect for SNe Ia relative to SNe II. We note some extreme and interesting supernova-host pairs, including the metal-poor (~1/4 solar) host of the recent SN Ia 2007bk, where the supernova was found well outside of this dwarf galaxy. To extend the luminosity range of supernova hosts to even fainter galaxies, we also match all the supernovae with z<0.3 to the SDSS DR6 sky images, resulting in 1225 matches. This allows us to identify some even more extreme cases, such as the recent SN Ic 2007bg, where the likely host of this hypernova-like event has an absolute magnitude M<SUB>B</SUB>~-12, making it one of the least luminous supernova hosts ever observed. This low-luminosity host is certain to be very metal-poor (~1/20 solar), and therefore this supernova is an excellent candidate for association with an off-axis GRB. The two catalogs that we have constructed are available online and will be updated regularly. Finally, we discuss various implications of our findings for understanding supernova progenitors and their host galaxies.},

@article{Hsiao:2007,
	Abstract = {With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) surveys, K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broadband colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series that incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broadband colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of ~600 observed spectra of ~100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

	Abstract = {We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the ~3 sigma detection of a ``Hubble bubble''-a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation (beta) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favor a Hubble bubble. We find that SN data give beta~=2, instead of the beta~=4 one would expect from purely Milky Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

	Abstract = {Near-infrared and radio searches for core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) in the local universe have shown that the vast majority of the events occurring in massive starburst are missed by the current optical searches as they explode in very dusty environments. Recent infrared observations have shown that the fraction of star formation activity that takes place in very luminous dusty starbursts sharply increases with redshift and becomes the dominant star formation component at z >= 0.5. As a consequence, an increasing fraction of SNe are expected to be missed by high-redshift optical searches. We estimate that 5-10 per cent of the local CC SNe are out of reach of the optical searches. The fraction of missing events rises sharply towards z = 1, when about 30 per cent of the CC SNe will be undetected. At z = 2 the missing fraction will be about 60 per cent. Correspondingly, for Type Ia SNe, our computations provide missing fractions of 15 per cent at z = 1 and 35 per cent at z = 2. Such large corrections are crucially important to compare the observed SN rate with the expectations from the evolution of the cosmic star formation history, and to design the future SN searches at high redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We present Spitzer MIPS 24 mum observations of 50 supernova host galaxies at 0.1<z<1.7 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. We also discuss the detection of SN host galaxies in SCUBA/850 mum observations of GOODS-N and Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) 16 mum observations of GOODS-S. About 60% of the host galaxies of both Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae are detected at 24 mum, a detection rate that is a factor of 1.5 higher than the field galaxy population. Among the 24 mum detected hosts, 80% have far-infrared luminosities that are comparable to or greater than the optical luminosity, indicating the presence of substantial amounts of dust in the hosts. The median bolometric luminosity of the Type Ia SN hosts is ~10<SUP>10.5</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>, very similar to that of core-collapse SN hosts. Using the high-resolution HST ACS data, we have studied the variation of rest-frame optical/ultraviolet colors within the 24 mum detected galaxies at z<1 to understand the origin of the dust emission. The 24 mum detected galaxies have average colors that are redder by ~0.1 mag than the 24 mum undetected hosts, while the latter show greater scatter in internal colors. This suggests that a smooth distribution of dust is responsible for the observed mid- and far-infrared emission. Of the supernovae that have been detected in the GOODS fields, 70% are located within the half-light radius of the hosts, where dust obscuration effects are significant. Although the dust emission that we detect cannot be translated into a line-of-sight A<SUB>V</SUB>, we suggest that the factor of 2-3 larger scatter in the peak B-V colors that is seen in the high-z Type Ia supernova sample relative to the low-z supernovae might be partially due to the dust that we detect in the hosts.},

@article{Holwerda:2008,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a mechanism that may modify the extinction law for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) observed at higher redshift. Starting from the observations that (i) SNeIa occur predominantly in spiral galaxies, (ii) star formation ejects interstellar medium (ISM) out of the plane of spirals, (iii) star formation alters the extinction properties of the dust in the ISM, and (iv) there is substantially more star formation at higher redshift, I propose that spiral galaxies have a dustier halo in the past than they do now. The ejected material's lower value of R<SUB>V</SUB> will lead to a lower average value for SNeIa observed at higher redshift.  Two relations in SNIa observations indicate evolution of the average R<SUB>V</SUB>: the relation of observed R<SUB>V</SUB> with inclination of the host galaxy at low redshift and the matching of the distribution of extinction values (A<SUB>V</SUB>) for SNeIa in different redshift intervals. The inclination effect does point to a halo with lower R<SUB>V</SUB> values. In contrast, the distributions of A<SUB>V</SUB> values match best for an evolution that mimics the relation of SNIa dimming with redshift attributed to the cosmological constant. However, even in the worse-case scenario, the evolution cannot fully explain the dimming of SNeIa: host galaxy extinction law evolution is not a viable alternative to account for the dimming of SNeIa.  Future observations of SNeIa - multicolour light curves and spectra - will solve separately for values of A<SUB>V</SUB> and R<SUB>V</SUB> foreach SNIa. Solving for evolution of (and A<SUB>V</SUB>) with redshift will be important for the coming generation of cosmological SNIa measurements and has the bonus science of insight into the distribution of dust-rich ISM in the host galaxies in the distant past.},

	Abstract = {B-band light-curve rise times for eight unusually well-observed nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fitted by a newly developed template-building algorithm, using light-curve functions that are smooth, flexible, and free of potential bias from externally derived templates and other prior assumptions. From the available literature, photometric BVRI data collected over many months, including the earliest points, are reconciled, combined, and fitted to a unique time of explosion for each SN. On average, after they are corrected for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81+/-0.36 days, while five SNe rise in 16.64+/-0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single parent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rms intrinsic scatter of the decline rate-corrected SN rise time is 0.96<SUP>+0.52</SUP><SUB>-0.25</SUB> days, a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding global mean rise time is 17.44+/-0.39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated by intrinsic variance. This value is ~2 days shorter than two published averages that nominally are twice as precise, although also based on small samples. When comparing high-z to low-z SN luminosities for determining cosmological parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an unrealistic rise time. If the period over which light curves are sampled depends on z in a manner typical of current search and measurement strategies, a 2 day discrepancy in template rise time can bias the luminosity comparison by ~0.03 mag.},

	Abstract = {We show empirically that fits to the color-magnitude relation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) after optical maximum can provide accurate relative extragalactic distances. We report the discovery of an empirical color relation for SN Ia light curves: during much of the first month past maximum, the magnitudes of SNe Ia defined at a given value of color index have a very small magnitude dispersion; moreover, during this period the relation between B magnitude and B-V color (or B-R or B-I color) is strikingly linear, to the accuracy of existing well-measured data. These linear relations can provide robust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the SN reaches a given color. After correction for light-curve stretch factor or decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the linear color-magnitude relation is found to be around 0.08 mag for the subsample of SNe with (B<SUB>max</SUB>-V<SUB>max</SUB>)<=0.05 mag and around 0.11 mag for the subsample with (B<SUB>max</SUB>-V<SUB>max</SUB>)<=0.2 mag. This small dispersion is consistent with being mostly due to observational errors. The method presented here and the conventional light-curve fitting methods can be combined to further improve statistical dispersions of distance estimates. It can be combined with the magnitude at maximum to deduce dust extinction. The slopes of the color-magnitude relation may also be used to identify intrinsically different SN Ia systems. The method provides a tool that is fundamental to using SNe Ia to estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass and dark energy content of the universe.},

	Abstract = {We present a family of six BVI template light curves for SNe Ia for days -5 and +80, based on high-quality data gathered at CTIO. These templates display a wide range of light-curve morphologies, with initial decline rates of their B light curves between {DELTA}m_15_(B) = 0.87^m^ and 1.93^m^. We use these templates to study the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of the main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with {DELTA}m_15_(B). In particular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good approximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in shapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the least-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed spectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one parameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show significant differences in their light curve properties when examined in detail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.},

	Abstract = {Aims.We present an empirical model of type Ia supernovae spectro-photometric evolution with time.  Methods: The model is built using a large data set including light-curves and spectra of both nearby and distant supernovae, the latter being observed by the SNLS collaboration. We derive the average spectral sequence of type Ia supernovae and their main variability components including a color variation law. The model allows us to measure distance moduli in the spectral range 2500-8000 � with calculable uncertainties, including those arising from variability of spectral features.  Results: Thanks to the use of high-redshift SNe to model the rest-frame UV spectral energy distribution, we are able to derive improved distance estimates for SNe Ia in the redshift range 0.8<z<1.1. The model can also be used to improve spectroscopic identification algorithms, and derive photometric redshifts of distant type Ia supernovae.

	Abstract = {We present a new method to parameterize type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) multi-color light curves. The method was developed in order to analyze the large number of SN Ia multi-color light curves measured in current high-redshift projects. The technique is based on empirically modeling SN Ia luminosity variations as a function of phase, wavelength, a shape parameter, and a color parameter. The model is trained with a sample of well-measured nearby SN Ia and then tested with an independent set of supernovae by building an optimal luminosity distance estimator that combines the supernova rest-frame luminosity, shape parameter, and color reconstructed with the model. The distances we measure using B- and V-band data show a dispersion around the Hubble line comparable or lower than obtained with other methods. With this model, we are able to measure distances using U- and B-band data with a dispersion of 0.16�0.05 around the Hubble line.},

	Abstract = {Published B and V fluxes from nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are fitted to light-curve templates with four to six adjustable parameters. Separately, B magnitudes from the same sample are fitted to a linear dependence on B-V color within a postmaximum time window prescribed by the CMAGIC method. These fits yield two independent SN magnitude estimates B<SUB>max</SUB> and B<SUB>BV</SUB>. Their difference varies systematically with decline-rate Deltam<SUB>15</SUB> in a form that is compatible with a bilinear but not a linear dependence; a nonlinear form likely describes the decline-rate dependence of B<SUB>max</SUB> itself. A Hubble fit to the average of B<SUB>max</SUB> and B<SUB>BV</SUB> requires a systematic correction for observed B-V color that can be described by a linear coefficient R;=2.59+/-0.24, well below the coefficient R<SUB>B</SUB>~4.1 commonly used to characterize the effects of Milky Way dust. At 99.9% confidence the data reject a simple model in which no color correction is required for SNe that are clustered at the blue end of their observed color distribution. After systematic corrections are performed, B<SUB>max</SUB> and B<SUB>BV</SUB> exhibit mutual rms intrinsic variation equal to 0.074+/-0.019 mag, of which at least an equal share likely belongs to B<SUB>BV</SUB>. SN magnitudes measured using maximum luminosity or CMAGIC methods show comparable rms deviations of order ~0.14 mag from the Hubble line. The same fit also establishes a 95% confidence upper limit of 486 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> on the rms peculiar velocity of nearby SNe relative to the Hubble flow.},

This is an independent set of high-redshift SNe that confirms previous SN evidence for an accelerating universe. The high-quality light curves available from photometry on WFPC2 make it possible for these 11 SNe alone to provide measurements of the cosmological parameters comparable in statistical weight to the previous results. Combined with earlier Supernova Cosmology Project data, the new SNe yield a measurement of the mass density Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.25<SUP>+0.07</SUP><SUB>-0.06</SUB>(statistical)+/-0.04 (identified systematics), or equivalently, a cosmological constant of Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=0.75<SUP>+0.06</SUP><SUB>-0.07</SUB>(statistical)+/-0.04 (identified systematics), under the assumptions of a flat universe and that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter has a constant value w=-1. When the SN results are combined with independent flat-universe measurements of Omega<SUB>M</SUB> from cosmic microwave background and galaxy redshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of w=-1.05<SUP>+0.15</SUP><SUB>-0.20</SUB>(statistical)+/-0.09 (identified systematic), if w is assumed to be constant in time. In addition to high-precision light-curve measurements, the new data offer greatly improved color measurements of the high-redshift SNe and hence improved host galaxy extinction estimates. These extinction measurements show no anomalous negative E(B-V) at high redshift. The precision of the measurements is such that it is possible to perform a host galaxy extinction correction directly for individual SNe without any assumptions or priors on the parent E(B-V) distribution. Our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that dark energy is required with P(Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>>0)>0.99, a result consistent with previous and current SN analyses that rely on the identification of a low-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinction distribution.

	Abstract = {R-band intensity measurements along the light curve of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) are fitted in brightness to templates allowing a free parameter the time-axis width factor w≡s(1+z). The data points are then individually aligned in the time axis, normalized, and K-corrected back to the rest frame, after which the nearly 1300 normalized intensity measurements are found to lie on a well-determined common rest-frame B-band curve, which we call the ``composite curve.'' The same procedure is applied to 18 low-redshift Cal�n/Tololo SNe with z<0.11 these nearly 300 B-band photometry points are found to lie on the composite curve equally well. The SCP search technique produces several measurements before maximum light for each supernova. We demonstrate that the linear stretch factor, s, which parameterizes the light-curve timescale, appears independent of z, and applies equally well to the declining and rising parts of the light curve. In fact, the B-band template that best fits this composite curve fits the individual supernova photometry data when stretched by a factor s with chi<SUP>2</SUP>/dof~1-thus, as well as any parameterization can, given the current data sets. The measurement of the date of explosion, however, is model dependent and not tightly constrained by the current data. We also demonstrate the 1+z light-curve time-axis broadening expected from cosmological expansion. This argues strongly against alternative explanations, such as tired light, for the redshift of distant objects.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a technique to systematically discover and study high-redshift supernovae that can be used to measure the cosmological parameters. We report here results based on the initial seven of more than 28 supernovae discovered to date in the high-redshift supernova search of the Supernova Cosmology Project. We find an observational dispersion in peak magnitudes of sigma _{M<SUB>B</SUB>}=0.27 ; this dispersion narrows to sigma _{M<SUB>B</SUB>,{corr}}=0.19 after "correcting" the magnitudes using the light-curve "width-luminosity" relation found for nearby (z <= 0.1) Type Ia supernovae from the Calan/Tololo survey (Hamuy et al.). Comparing light-curve width--corrected magnitudes as a function of redshift of our distant (z = 0.35--0.46) supernovae to those of nearby Type Ia supernovae yields a global measurement of the mass density, Omega _{{M}}=0.88^{+0.69}_{-0.60} for a Lamda = 0 cosmology. For a spatially flat universe (i.e., Omega M + Omega Lamda = 1), we find Omega _{{M}}=0.94^{+0.34}_{-0.28} or, equivalently, a measurement of the cosmological constant, Omega _{ Lamda }=0.06^{+0.28}_{-0.34} (<0.51 at the 95% confidence level). For the more general Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmologies with independent Omega M and Omega Lamda , the results are presented as a confidence region on the Omega M- Omega Lamda plane. This region does not correspond to a unique value of the deceleration parameter q0. We present analyses and checks for statistical and systematic errors and also show that our results do not depend on the specifics of the width-luminosity correction. The results for Omega Lamda -versus- Omega M are inconsistent with Lamda -dominated, low-density, flat cosmologies that have been proposed to reconcile the ages of globular cluster stars with higher Hubble constant values.},

	Abstract = {We present an updated version of the multicolor light-curve shape method to measure distances to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), incorporating new procedures for K-correction and extinction corrections. We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SNe Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz>=2500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SNe Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find that the Hubble flow SNe with H<SUB>0</SUB>d<SUB>SN</SUB>>=7400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> yield an expansion rate that is 6.5%+/-1.8% lower than the rate determined from SNe within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SNe Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background. Direct fits of SNe Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest that their mean extinction law may be described by R<SUB>V</SUB>~=2.7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R<SUB>V</SUB>.},

	Abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes (MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a "training set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of 20 SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5% for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Sandage et al. Cepheid distance scale of H_0_ = 64 +/- 3 (statistical) km s^-1^ Mpc^-1^ (+/-6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 +/- 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 < mu < 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.},

	Abstract = {Large photometric surveys with the aim of identifying many Type Ia supernovae (SNe) at moderate redshift are challenged in separating these SNe from other SN types. We are motivated to identify Type Ia SNe based only on broadband photometric information, since spectroscopic determination of the SN type, the traditional method, requires significant amounts of time on large telescopes. We consider the possible observables provided by a large synoptic photometry survey. We examine the optical colors and magnitudes of many SN types from z=0.1 to 1.0, using space-based UV spectra and ground-based optical spectra to simulate the photometry. We also discuss the evolution of colors over the SN outburst and the use of host galaxy characteristics to aid in the identification of Type Ia SNe. We consider magnitudes both in the SDSS photometric system and in a proposed filter system with logarithmically spaced bandpasses. We find that photometric information in four bands covering the entire optical spectrum appears capable of providing identification of Type Ia SNe based on their colors at a single observed epoch soon after maximum light, even without independent estimates of the SN redshift. Very blue filters are extremely helpful, as at moderate redshift they sample the rest-frame UV spectrum where the SN types are very different. We emphasize the need for further observations of SNe in the rest-frame UV to fully characterize, refine, and improve this method of SN type identification.},

	Abstract = {We have discovered 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence for cosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration. These objects, discovered during the course of the GOODS ACS Treasury program, include 6 of the 7 highest redshift SNe Ia known, all at z>1.25, and populate the Hubble diagram in unexplored territory. The luminosity distances to these objects and to 170 previously reported SNe Ia have been determined using empirical relations between light-curve shape and luminosity. A purely kinematic interpretation of the SN Ia sample provides evidence at the greater than 99% confidence level for a transition from deceleration to acceleration or, similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46+/-0.13. The data are consistent with the cosmic concordance model of Omega<SUB>M</SUB>~0.3,Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>~0.7 (chi<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>dof</SUB>=1.06) and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dust as an alternative to dark energy. For a flat universe with a cosmological constant, we measure Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.29+/-<SUP>0.05</SUP><SUB>0.03</SUB> (equivalently, Omega<SUB>Lambda</SUB>=0.71). When combined with external flat-universe constraints, including the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure, we find w=-1.02+/-<SUP>0.13</SUP><SUB>0.19</SUB> (and w<-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed static equation of state of dark energy, P=wrhoc<SUP>2</SUP>. Joint constraints on both the recent equation of state of dark energy, w<SUB>0</SUB>, and its time evolution, dw/dz, are a factor of ~8 more precise than the first estimates and twice as precise as those without the SNe Ia discovered with HST. Our constraints are consistent with the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant (i.e., w<SUB>0</SUB>=-1.0, dw/dz=0) and are inconsistent with very rapid evolution of dark energy. We address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate of the universe.

Photometric redshift measurements of the hosts combined with deep F606W, F775W, and F850LP imaging discriminates hydrogen-rich SNe II from SNe I at z>1 by exploiting the UV deficit in the energy distributions of SNe Ia. This sorting allows rapid follow-up of space-based discoveries. Subsequent spectroscopy of 11 GOODS SNe Ia obtained from the ground and with the grism on ACS confirmed the reliability of our photometric screening. We present the highest redshift spectrum of any SN published to date, SN Ia 2002fw at z=1.3 observed near maximum brightness with the ACS grism. The lack of UV flux for true SNe Ia provides an effective tool for our ongoing efforts to build a sample of SNe Ia at 1.2<z<1.8, which will extend the useful range of the magnitude-redshift relation of SNe Ia.

	Abstract = {Large numbers of supernovae (SNe) have been discovered in recent years, and many more will be found in the near future. Once discovered, further study of a SN and its possible use as an astronomical tool (e.g., as a distance estimator) require knowledge of the SN type. Current classification methods rely almost solely on the analysis of SN spectra to determine their type. However, spectroscopy may not be possible or practical when SNe are faint, numerous, or discovered in archival studies. We present a classification method for SNe based on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones, calculated from a large database of multiepoch optical spectra of nearby events. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method. For example, Type Ia SNe at redshifts z<0.1 can be distinguished from most other SN types during the first few weeks of their evolution, based on V-R versus R-I colors. Type II-P SNe have distinct (very red) colors at late (t>100 days) stages. Broadband photometry through standard Johnson-Cousins UBVRI filters can be useful to classify SNe out to z~0.6. The use of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz filters allows the extension of our classification method to even higher redshifts (z=0.75), and the use of infrared bands, to z=2.5. We demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered SN from the SDSS. Finally, we outline the observational data required to further improve the sensitivity of the method and discuss prospects for its use on future SN samples.

The blackbody supernova theoretical construct is introduced, and it is shown that, for a given composition, the homogeneity of spectral evolution is a necessary consequence of the thermonuclear model while being only a possible consequence of the gravitational collapse model. A factor-of-two variation in explosion energy is suggested by comparison of 1970j with 1972e, with a corresponding variation in intrinsic luminosity at maximum light.},

@article{Phillips:1993,
	Abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

@article{Howell:2005,
	Abstract = {We present new techniques for improving the efficiency of supernova (SN) classification at high redshift using 64 candidates observed at Gemini North and South during the first year of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The SNLS is an ongoing 5 year project with the goal of measuring the equation of state of dark energy by discovering and following over 700 high-redshift SNe Ia using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We achieve an improvement in the SN Ia spectroscopic confirmation rate: at Gemini 71% of candidates are now confirmed as SNe Ia, compared to 54% using the methods of previous surveys. This is despite the comparatively high redshift of this sample, in which the median SN Ia redshift is z=0.81 (0.155<=z<=1.01). These improvements were realized because we use the unprecedented color coverage and light curve sampling of the SNLS to predict whether a candidate is a SN Ia and to estimate its redshift, before obtaining a spectrum, using a new technique called the ``SN photo-z.'' In addition, we have improved techniques for galaxy subtraction and SN template chi<SUP>2</SUP> fitting, allowing us to identify candidates even when they are only 15% as bright as the host galaxy. The largest impediment to SN identification is found to be host galaxy contamination of the spectrum-when the SN was at least as bright as the underlying host galaxy the target was identified more than 90% of the time. However, even SNe in bright host galaxies can be easily identified in good seeing conditions. When the image quality was better than 0.55", the candidate was identified 88% of the time. Over the 5 year course of the survey, using the selection techniques presented here, we will be able to add ~170 more confirmed SNe Ia than would be possible using previous methods.

@article{Bronder:2008,
	Abstract = {Aims.We present a quantitative study of a new data set of high redshift Type Ia supernovae spectra, observed at the Gemini telescopes during the first 34 months of the Supernova Legacy Survey. During this time 123 supernovae candidates were observed, of which 87 have been identified as SNe Ia at a median redshift of z=0.720. Spectra from the entire second year of the survey and part of the third year (59 total SNe candidates with 46 confirmed SNe Ia) are published here for the first time. The spectroscopic measurements made on this data set are used determine if these distant SNe comprise a population similar to those observed locally.   Methods: Rest-frame equivalent width and ejection velocity measurements are made on four spectroscopic features. Corresponding measurements are presented for a set of 167 spectra from 24 low-z SNe Ia from the literature.  Results: We show that there exists a sample at high redshift with properties similar to nearby SNe. The high-z measurements are consistent with the range of measurements at low-z and no significant difference was found between the distributions of measurements at low and high redsift for three of the features. The fourth feature displays a possible difference that should be investigated further. Correlations between Type Ia SNe properties and host galaxy morphology were also found to be similar at low and high z, and within each host galaxy class we see no evidence for redshift-evolution in SN properties. A new correlation between SNe Ia peak magnitude and the equivalent width of SiII absorption is presented. Tests on a sub-set of the SNLS SNe demonstrates that this correlation reduces the scatter in SNe Ia luminosity distances in a manner consistent with the lightcurve shape-luminosity corrections that are used for Type Ia SNe cosmology.  Conclusions: We show that this new sample of SNLS SNe Ia has spectroscopic properties similar to nearby objects.

These results are consistent with those reported by the Supernova Legacy Survey from the first year of a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. We evaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations and present Monte Carlo simulations that explore these effects. Currently, the largest systematic with the potential to affect our measurements is the treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies. Combining our set of ESSENCE SNe Ia with the first-results Supernova Legacy Survey SNe Ia, we obtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07<SUP>+0.09</SUP><SUB>-0.09</SUB> (stat 1 sigma)+/-0.13 (sys), Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.267<SUP>+0.028</SUP><SUB>-0.018</SUB> (stat 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi<SUP>2</SUP>/dof of 0.91.

@article{Barris:2005,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for optimally extracting point-source time variability information from a series of images. Differential photometry is generally best accomplished by subtracting two images separated in time, since this removes all constant objects in the field. By removing background sources such as the host galaxies of supernovae, such subtractions make possible the measurement of the proper flux of point-source objects superposed on extended sources. In traditional difference photometry, a single image is designated as the ``template'' image and is subtracted from all other observations. This procedure does not take all the available information into account and for suboptimal template images may produce poor results. Given N total observations of an object, we show how to obtain an estimate of the vector of fluxes from the individual images using the antisymmetric matrix of flux differences formed from the N(N-1)/2 distinct possible subtractions and provide a prescription for estimating the associated uncertainties. We then demonstrate how this method improves results over the standard procedure of designating one image as a template and differencing against only that image.},

	Abstract = {We derive the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) over a wide range of redshifts using a complete sample from the IfA Deep Survey. This sample of more than 100 SNe Ia is the largest set ever collected from a single survey and therefore uniquely powerful for a detailed supernova rate (SNR) calculation. Measurements of the SNR as a function of cosmological time offer a glimpse into the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) and Type Ia SNR and may provide evidence for the progenitor pathway. We observe a progressively increasing Type Ia SNR between redshifts z~0.3 and 0.8. The Type Ia SNR measurements are consistent with a short time delay (t~1 Gyr) with respect to the SFR, indicating a fairly prompt evolution of SN Ia progenitor systems. We derive a best-fit value of SFR/SNR~580 h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> per SN Ia for the conversion factor between the star formation and the SN Ia rates, as determined for a delay time of t~1 Gyr between the SFR and the Type Ia SNR. More complete measurements of the Type Ia SNR at z>1 are necessary to conclusively determine the SFR-SNR relationship and constrain SN Ia evolutionary pathways.},

	Abstract = {We describe a procedure for accurately determining luminosity distances to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) without knowledge of redshift. This procedure, which may be used as an extension of any of the various distance determination methods currently in use, is based on marginalizing over redshift, removing the requirement of knowing z a priori. We demonstrate that the Hubble diagram scatter of distances measured with this technique is approximately equal to that of distances derived from conventional redshift-specific methods for a set of 60 nearby SNe Ia. This indicates that accurate distances for cosmological SNe Ia may be determined without the requirement of spectroscopic redshifts, which are typically the limiting factor for the number of SNe that modern surveys can collect. Removing this limitation would greatly increase the number of SNe for which current and future SN surveys will be able to accurately measure distance. The method also may be able to be used for high-z SNe Ia to determine cosmological density parameters without redshift information.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for determining the probability that a supernova candidate belongs to a known supernova type (such as Ia, Ibc, IIL, etc.) using its photometric information alone. It is validated with Monte Carlo simulations, and both space- and ground-based data. We examine the application of the method to well-sampled as well as poorly sampled supernova light curves and investigate to what extent the best currently available supernova models can be used for typing supernova candidates. Central to the method is the assumption that a supernova candidate belongs to a group of objects that can be modeled; we therefore discuss possible ways of removing anomalous or less well understood events from the sample. This method is particularly advantageous for analyses where the purity of the supernova sample is important, or for those where it is important to know the number of the supernova candidates of a certain type (e.g., in supernova rate studies).},

	Abstract = {We compare the rise times of nearby and distant Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as a test for evolution using 73 high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia from the first 2 years of the 5 year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and published observations of nearby SNe. Because of the ``rolling'' search nature of the SNLS, our measurement is approximately 6 times more precise than previous studies, allowing for a more sensitive test of evolution between nearby and distant SNe. Adopting a simple t<SUP>2</SUP> early-time model (as in previous studies), we find that the rest-frame B rise times for a fiducial SN Ia at high and low redshift are consistent, with values 19.10<SUP>+0.18</SUP><SUB>-0.17</SUB>(stat)+/-0.2(syst) and 19.58<SUP>+0.22</SUP><SUB>-0.19</SUB> days, respectively; the statistical significance of this difference is only 1.4 sigma. The errors represent the uncertainty in the mean rather than any variation between individual SNe. We also compare subsets of our high-redshift data set based on decline rate, host galaxy star formation rate, and redshift, finding no substantive evidence for any subsample dependence.

The fiducial rise time of the nearby SNe Ia is 2.5+/-0.4 days longer than the preliminary measurement of the rise time in 1998 by Goldhaber and by Groom for high-redshift SNe Ia from the Supernova Cosmology Project. If further analysis of the high-redshift data does not lead to a significant change in the value or uncertainty in the rise time, then the statistical likelihood that the two samples have different fiducial rise times remains high (5.8 sigma) and indicates possible evolution between the samples of SNe Ia. We consider the likely effects of several sources of systematic error, but none of these resolves the difference in the rise times. Currently, we cannot directly determine the impact of the apparent evolution on previous determinations of cosmological parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present calibrated photometric measurements of the earliest detections of nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The set of ~30 new, unfiltered CCD observations delineate the early rise behavior of SNe Ia 18 to 10 days before maximum. Using simple empirical models, we demonstrate the strong correlation between the rise time (i.e., the time between explosion and maximum), the postrise light-curve shape, and the peak luminosity. Using a variety of light-curve shape methods, we find the rise time to B maximum for an SN Ia with Deltam<SUB>15</SUB>(B)=1.1 mag and peak M<SUB>V</SUB>=-19.45 mag to be 19.5+/-0.2 days. We find that the peak brightness of SNe Ia is correlated with their rise time; SNe Ia that are 0.10 mag brighter at peak in the B band require 0.80+/-0.05 days longer to reach maximum light. We determine the effects of several possible sources of systematic errors, but none of these significantly impacts the inferred rise time. We explore the degree to which comparisons between the observed and theoretically predicted rise times constrain SN Ia progenitor systems.},

	Abstract = {A key question for supernova cosmology is whether the peak luminosities of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic evolution. To answer this question, we review the currently popular scenario of SN Ia progenitors, i.e. the single degenerate scenario for the Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models. We identify the progenitor's evolution with two channels: (1) the WD+RG (red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. The strong wind from accreting WDs plays a key role, which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. We suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction X(C) in the C+O WD (or the variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of SN Ia brightness. This model can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brightness on the galaxy types. We then predict how SN Ia brightness evolves along the redshift (with changing metallicity and age) for elliptical and spiral galaxies. Such evolutionary effects along the redshift can be corrected as has been made for local SNe Ia. We also touch on several related issues: (1) the abundance pattern of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in relation to the metallicity effect on SNe Ia, (2) effects of angular momentum brought into the WD in relation to the diversities and the fate of double degenerates, and (3) possible presence of helium in the peculiar SN Ia 2000cx in relation to the sub-Chandrasekhar mass model.

	Abstract = {We apply an ad hoc model for dynamical ignition in three-dimensional numerical simulations of thermonuclear supernovae assuming pure deflagrations. The model makes use of the statistical description of temperature fluctuations in the pre-supernova core proposed by Wunsch & Woosley (2004, ApJ, 616, 1102). Randomness in time is implemented by means of a Poisson process. We are able to vary the explosion energy and nucleosynthesis depending on the free parameter of the model which controls the rapidity of the ignition process. However, beyond a certain threshold, the strength of the explosion saturates and the outcome appears to be robust with respect to the number of ignitions. In the most energetic explosions, we find about 0.75~M<SUB>o</SUB> of iron group elements. Other than in simulations with simultaneous multi-spot ignition, the amount of unburned carbon and oxygen at radial velocities of a few 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> tends to be reduced for an ever increasing number of ignition events and, accordingly, more pronounced layering results.},

@article{Ropke:2007,
	Abstract = {A simulation of the thermonuclear explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass C+O white dwarf, the most popular scenario of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), is presented. The underlying modeling is pursued in a self-consistent way, treating the combustion wave as a turbulent deflagration using well tested methods developed for laboratory combustion and based on the concept of ``large-eddy simulations'' (LESs). Such consistency requires to capture the onset of the turbulent cascade on resolved scales. This is achieved by computing the dynamical evolution on a 1024<SUP>3</SUP> moving grid, which resulted in the best-resolved three-dimensional SN Ia simulation carried out thus far, reaching the limits of what can be done on present supercomputers. Consequently, the model has no free parameters other than the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it has considerable predictive power. Our main objective is to determine to which extent such a simulation can account for the observations of normal SNe Ia. Guided by previous simulations with less resolution and a less sophisticated flame model, initial conditions were chosen that yield a reasonably strong explosion and a sufficient amount of radioactive nickel for a bright display. We show that observables are indeed matched to a reasonable degree. In particular, good agreement is found with the light curves of normal SNe Ia. Moreover, the model reproduces the general features of the abundance stratification as inferred from the analysis of spectra. This indicates that it captures the main features of the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia. However, we also show that even a seemingly best-choice pure deflagration model has shortcomings that indicate the need for a different mode of nuclear burning at late times, perhaps the transition to a detonation at low density.},

	Abstract = {Because calibrated light curves of type Ia supernovae have become a major tool to determine the local expansion rate of the universe and also its geometrical structure, considerable attention has been given to models of these events over the past couple of years. There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, M<SUB>chan</SUB> ≈ 1.39M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.},

For our survey on the CTIO 4 m telescope, measuring the luminosity distances and redshifts for supernovae at modest redshifts (z~0.5+/-0.2) is optimal for determining w. We describe the data analysis pipeline based on using reliable and robust image subtraction to find supernovae automatically and in nearly real time. Since making cosmological inferences with supernovae relies crucially on accurate measurement of their apparent brightnesses, we describe our efforts to establish a thorough calibration of the CTIO 4 m telescope's natural photometric system. In its first four years, ESSENCE has discovered and spectroscopically confirmed 102 Type Ia supernovae, at redshifts from 0.10 to 0.78, identified through an impartial, effective methodology for spectroscopic classification and redshift determination.

@article{Calura:2006,
	Abstract = {We compute the Type Ia, Ib/c, and II supernova (SN) rates as functions of the cosmic time for galaxies of different morphological types. We use four different chemical evolution models, each one reproducing the features of a particular morphological type: E/S0, S0a/b, Sbc/d, and Irr galaxies. We essentially describe the Hubble sequence by means of decreasing efficiency of star formation and increasing infall timescale. These models are used to study the evolution of the SN rates per unit luminosity and per unit mass as functions of cosmic time and as functions of the Hubble type. Our results indicate that (1) the observed increase of the SN rate per unit luminosity and unit mass from early to late galaxy types is accounted for by our models. Our explanation of this effect is related to the fact that the latest Hubble types have the highest star formation rate per unit mass. (2) By adopting a Scalo initial mass function in spiral disks, we find that massive (i.e., with initial mass >25 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) single stars ending their lives as Wolf-Rayet objects are not sufficient to account for the observed Type Ib/c SN rate per unit mass. Less massive stars (i.e., with initial masses 12<M/M<SUB>solar</SUB><20) in close binary systems can give instead a significant contribution to the local Ib/c SN rates. On the other hand, with the assumption of a Salpeter IMF for all galaxy types, single massive W-R stars are sufficient to account for the observed Type Ib/c SN rate. (3) Our models allow us to reproduce the observed Type Ia SN rate density up to redshift z~1. At higher redshifts, our rates are higher than the few available data. In particular, we predict an increasing Type Ia SN rate density with redshift, reaching a peak at redshift z>=3, because of the contribution of massive spheroids. (4) At z=0, we reproduce the observed core-collapse (CC) SN rate density. Because of the few available observations, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the behavior of the CC SN rate at redshift z>0.},

	Abstract = {Aims.To measure the supernova (SN) rates at intermediate redshift we performed a search, the Southern inTermediate Redshift ESO Supernova Search (STRESS). Unlike most of the current high redshift SN searches, this survey was specifically designed to estimate the rate for both type Ia and core collapse (CC) SNe.  Methods: We counted the SNe discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring SN rate per unit blue band luminosity. Our analysis is based on a sample of  43 000 galaxies and on 25 spectroscopically confirmed SNe plus 64 selected SN candidates. Our approach is aimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates and at investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties, most notably their colour.  Results: The type Ia SN rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, is 0.22<SUP>+0.10 +0.16</SUP><SUB>-0.08 -0.14</SUB> h<SUB>70</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> SNu, while the CC SN rate, at z=0.21, is 0.82<SUP>+0.31 +0.30</SUP><SUB>-0.24 -0.26</SUB> h<SUB>70</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> SNu. The quoted errors are the statistical and systematic uncertainties.   Conclusions: With respect to the local value, the CC SN rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of  2, whereas the type Ia SN rate remains almost constant. This implies that a significant fraction of SN Ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2{-}3 Gyr. We also measured the SN rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the SN Ia rate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the CC SN rate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local Universe. SN rates per unit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing a steeper evolution with redshift for CC SNe than SNe Ia. We have exploited the link between SFH and SN rates to predict the evolutionary behaviour of the SN rates and compare it with the path indicated by observations. We conclude that in order to constrain the mass range of CC SN progenitors and SN Ia progenitor models it is necessary to reduce the uncertainties in the cosmic SFH. In addition it is important to apply a consistent dust extinction correction both to SF and to CC SN rate and to measure the SN Ia rate in star forming and in passively evolving galaxies over a wide redshift range.

@inproceedings{Panagia:2007,
	Abstract = {Recently, three important observational results were established: (a) The evolution of the SNIa rate with redshift is now measured up to z~1.6 and the results at the highest redshifts, derived by the GOODS collaboration show that the SN rate rises up to z~0.8, when the Universe was 6.5 Gyr old, and decreases afterward. (b) The rate of supernova explosions of the different types as a function of the galaxy (B-K) and the galaxy mass have been determined. It is found that the rates of all SN types, including Ia, Ib/c and II, show a marked increase with the star formation activity. (c) An analysis of SNIa events in early-type galaxies has provided conclusive evidence that the rate of SNIa in radio-loud galaxies is much higher than the rate measured in radio-quiet galaxies. This result suggests that repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early-type galaxies with dwarf companions are responsible for supplying an adequate number of SNIa progenitors to the stellar population of elliptical galaxies.  On this basis we have discussed the distribution of the delay time (DTD) between the formation of a SNIa progenitor star and its explosion as a SNIa. Our analysis finds: i) models with long delay times, say 3-4 Gyr, cannot reproduce the dependence of the SNIa rate on the colors and on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies; ii) the dependence of the SNIa rate on the parent galaxy colors requires models with a wide DTD, spanning the interval 100 Myr to 10 Gyr; iii) the dependence on the parent galaxy radio-luminosity requires substantial production of SNIa at epochs earlier than 100 Myr after the birth of a given stellar generation; iv) the comparison between observed SN rates and a grid of theoretical ``single-population'' DTDs shows that only a few of them are marginally consistent with all observations; v) the present data are best matched by a bimodal DTD, in which about 50% of type Ia SNe (``prompt'' SNIa) explode soon after their stellar birth, in a time of the order of 100 Myrs, while the remaining 50% (``tardy'' SNIa) have a much wider distribution, well described by an exponential function with a decay time of about 3 Gyr. This fact, coupled with the well established bimodal distribution of the decay rate, suggests the existence of two classes of progenitors and/or explosive channels. We discuss the cosmological implications of this result and make simple predictions.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) rates are a potentially powerful diagnostic of star formation history (SFH), metal enrichment, and SN physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials and simple SFH. However, a low-redshift cluster SN rate has never been published. We derive the SN rate in galaxy clusters at 0.06<z<0.19, based on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that were discovered by the Wise Observatory Optical Transient Survey. As described in a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich Abell clusters was monitored, in which six cluster SNe Ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. Here we determine the SN detection efficiencies of the individual survey images and combine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of SNe Ia to calculate the effective visibility time of the survey. The cluster stellar luminosities are measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database in the griz SDSS bands. Uncertainties are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations in which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their known distributions. We derive SN rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in SNu (supernova units, SNe per century per 10<SUP>10</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>) in five photometric bandpasses, 0.36<SUP>+0.22</SUP><SUB>-0.14</SUB>+/-0.02 (B), 0.351<SUP>+0.210</SUP><SUB>-0.139</SUB>+/-0.020 (g), 0.288<SUP>+0.172</SUP><SUB>-0.114</SUB>+/-0.018 (r), 0.229<SUP>+0.137</SUP><SUB>-0.091</SUB>+/-0.014 (i), and 0.186<SUP>+0.111</SUP><SUB>-0.074</SUB>+/-0.010 (z), where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. The SN rate per stellar mass unit, derived using a color-luminosity-mass relation, is 0.098<SUP>+0.059</SUP><SUB>-0.039</SUB>+/-0.009 SNe (100 yr 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. The low cluster SN rates we find are similar to, and consistent with, the SN Ia rate in local elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We report a measurement of the supernova (SN) rates (Type Ia and core-collapse) in galaxy clusters based on the 136 supernovae of the sample described in Cappellaro, Evans & Turatto, and Mannucci et al.  Early-type cluster galaxies show a Type Ia SN rate (0.066 SNuM) similar to that obtained by Sharon et al. and more than three times larger than that in field early-type galaxies (0.019 SNuM). This difference has a 98 per cent statistical confidence level. We examine many possible observational biases which could affect the rate determination, and conclude that none of them is likely to significantly alter the results. We investigate how the rate is related to several properties of the parent galaxies, and find that cluster membership, morphology and radio power all affect the SN rate, while galaxy mass has no measurable effect. The increased rate may be due to galaxy interactions in clusters, inducing either the formation of young stars or a different evolution of the progenitor binary systems.  We present the first measurement of the core-collapse SN rate in cluster late-type galaxies, which turns out to be comparable to the rate in field galaxies. This suggests that no large systematic difference in the initial mass function exists between the two environments.},

@article{Cappellaro:1999,
	Abstract = {We have computed new estimates of the local rates of supernovae (SNe) adding the updated log of Evans' visual search to our SN search database. In this way, we have accumulated the largest SN statistics ever assembled for this purpose. The new SN rates are corrected on an empirical basis for the bias in the inner regions of galaxies and that in inclined spirals. We also tested an alternative approach based on the simple model proposed by Hatano et al. (1998) for the SN and dust distribution in spirals. It turns out that, although the two approaches give similar average rates, the Hatano et al. model appears to overcorrect the SN rate of distant galaxies. We used these updated statistics to probe the SN rates with different tracers of the star formation activity in galaxies, namely integrated colors, infrared luminosities and nuclear activities. We found a clear relation between the core-collapse SN rate and the integrated galaxy color, which appears consistent with the prediction of galaxy evolutionary models. We also compared SN rates in galaxies with different L<SUB>FIR</SUB> with unfavorable outcome, and we argue that L<SUB>FIR</SUB> is not a universal measurement of SFR. Finally, we confirm that the SN rate is not enhanced in AGN host galaxies which indicates that the nuclear engine does not significantly stimulate the extranuclear SF.},

	Abstract = {We have compiled a sample of 45 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) and the Beijing Astronomical Observatory Supernova Survey (BAOSS), and determined the rate of spectroscopically peculiar SNe Ia (i.e., SN 1986G-like, SN 1991bg-like, and SN 1991T-like objects) and the luminosity function of SNe Ia. Because of the nature of the two surveys (distance-limited with small baselines and deep limiting magnitudes), nearly all SNe Ia have been discovered in the sample galaxies of LOSS and BAOSS; thus, the observed peculiarity rate and luminosity function of SNe Ia are intrinsic. We find that 36%+/-9% of nearby SNe Ia are peculiar; specifically, the luminosity function of SNe Ia consists of 20% SN 1991T-like, 64% normal, and 16% SN 1991bg-like objects. We have compared our results to those found by earlier studies, and to those found at high redshift. The apparent dearth of SN 1991T-like objects at high redshift may be due to extinction, and especially to the difficulty of recognizing them from spectra obtained past maximum brightness or from spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios. Implications of the high peculiarity rate for the progenitor systems of SNe Ia are also briefly discussed.},

@article{Modjaz:2008,
	Abstract = {We compare the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby (z < 0.14) Type Ic supernovae (SN Ic) that showed broad lines, but had no observed gamma-ray burst (GRB), with the chemical abundances in five nearby (z < 0.25) galaxies at the sites of GRBs where broad-lined SN Ic were seen after the fireball had faded. It has previously been noted that GRB hosts are low in luminosity and low in their metal abundances. If low metallicity is sufficient to force the evolution of massive stars to end their lives as GRBs with an accompanying broad-lined SN Ic, then we would expect higher metal abundances for the broad-lined SN Ic that have no detected GRBs. This is what we observe, and this trend is independent of the choice of metallicity calibration we adopt and the mode of SN survey that found the broad-lined SN Ic. A unique feature of this analysis is that we present new spectra of the host galaxies and analyze all measurements of both samples in the same set of methods, using the galaxy emission-line measurements corrected for extinction and stellar absorption, via independent metallicity diagnostics of Kewley & Dopita, McGaugh, and Pettini & Pagel. In our small sample, the boundary between galaxies that have GRBs accompanying their broad-lined SN Ic and those that have broad-lined SN Ic without GRBs lies at an oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H)<SUB>KD02</SUB> ~ 8.5, which corresponds to 0.2-0.6 Z<SUB>sun</SUB> depending on the adopted metallicity scale and solar abundance value. Even when we limit the comparison to SN Ic that were found in untargeted supernova surveys, the environment of every broad-lined SN Ic that had no GRB is more metal rich than the site of any broad-lined SN Ic where a GRB was detected.  This paper includes data gathered with the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona, and with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},
